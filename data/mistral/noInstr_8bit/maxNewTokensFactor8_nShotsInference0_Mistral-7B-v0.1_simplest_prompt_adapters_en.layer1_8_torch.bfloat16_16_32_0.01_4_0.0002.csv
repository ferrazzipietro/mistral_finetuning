In the family history, her mother, sisters and cousins underwent a surgery for MNG. Despite of the large volume of the mass, the patient never described signs of cervical compression whatsoever respiratory, digestive, laryngeal, vascular or neurologic signs. She never suffered from thyroid dysfunction. Her neck was deformed by the voluminous formation classified grade III according to the WHO modified classification. The mass took the front and the two sides of the neck. Its surface was embossed and covered by a thin normal skin. There were some veins of the collateral circulation limited to the neck. The goiter measured 18 x 11 cm. The mass was firm, painless, and mobile with the swallowing movements. Lymphadenopathy research was difficult and found no palpable lymph nodes. The laboratory tests (T 3, T 4 and TSH) were normal. Thoracic radiography showed a large cervical opacity roughly round and strewn with microcalcifications associated with a right eccentricity of the trachea. Cervical and chest CT revealed the presence of a partially calcified thyroid mass slightly plunging in the anterior mediastinum. It took heterogeneously the contrast and then evocate a large MNG. The trachea was surrounded by the goiter, slightly narrowed and right deviated as well as the lower part of the larynx. The right and left vascular axes of the neck (carotid artery and jugular vein) were deviated backward. The patient underwent a surgery for her enormous MNG slightly plunging in the mediastinum. Endotracheal intubation was relatively easy by the laryngoscope. The incision performed was a Kocher cervicotomy. There was a multinodular, hypervascularized goiter. Its lower end plunges behind the sternal manubrium. The larynx was deviated towards the right side. The total thyroidectomy was performed in two steps: initially a right lobo-isthmectomy, then the left lobectomy. The retrosternal part of the goiter was released using the finger by the same incision. Both recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) were not identified because of the hemorrhage. One parathyroid gland was accidently devascularized and was autotransplanted to the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. The operation was finished by double aspiration drainage. In the first hours after surgery, the patient developed a large cervical hematoma. She was readmitted to the operating room, and after evacuation of the hematoma there was no vessels bleeding. The operation was completed with a double suction drainage. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed hemodynamic collapse requiring the introduction of dobutamine. After 48 hours of hemodynamic support, the blood pressure stabilized and dobutamine was stopped. Histological study concluded in multinodular colloid goiter.

Its lower end plunges behind the sternal manubrium. The larynx was deviated towards the right side. The total thyroidectomy was performed in two steps: initially a right lobo-isthmectomy, then the left lobectomy. The retrosternal part of the goiter was released using the finger by the same incision. Both recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) were not identified because of the hemorrhage. One parathyroid gland was accidently devascularized and was autotransplanted to the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. The operation was finished by double aspiration drainage. In the first hours after surgery, the patient developed a large cervical hematoma. She was readmitted to the operating room, and after evacuation of the hematoma there was no vessels bleeding. The operation was completed with a double suction drainage. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed hemodynamic collapse requiring the introduction of dobutamine. After 48 hours of hemodynamic support, the blood pressure stabilized and dobutamine was stopped. Histological study concluded in multinodular colloid goiter. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 20 days in good health.

Its lower end plunges behind the sternal manubrium.,[],"A 50-years-old woman, hypertensive, hospitalized for a large cervical mass appeared 30 years ago. In the family history, her mother, sisters and cousins underwent a surgery for MNG. Despite of the large volume of the mass, the patient never described signs of cervical compression whatsoever respiratory, digestive, laryngeal, vascular or neurologic signs. She never suffered from thyroid dysfunction. Her neck was deformed by the voluminous formation classified grade III according to the WHO modified classification. The mass took the front and the two sides of the neck. Its surface was embossed and covered by a thin normal skin. There were some veins of the collateral circulation limited to the neck. The goiter measured 18 x 11 cm. The mass was firm, painless, and mobile with the swallowing movements. Lymphadenopathy research was difficult and found no palpable lymph nodes. The laboratory tests (T 3, T 4 and TSH) were normal. Thoracic radiography showed a large cervical opacity roughly round and strewn with microcalcifications associated with a right eccentricity of the trachea. Cervical and chest CT revealed the presence of a partially calcified thyroid mass slightly plunging in the anterior mediastinum. It took heterogeneously the contrast and then evocate a large MNG. The trachea was surrounded by the goiter, slightly narrowed and right deviated as well as the lower part of the larynx. The right and left vascular axes of the neck (carotid artery and jugular vein) were deviated backward. The patient underwent a surgery for her enormous MNG slightly plunging in the mediastinum. Endotracheal intubation was relatively easy by the laryngoscope. The incision performed was a Kocher cervicotomy. There was a multinodular, hypervascularized goiter. Its lower end plunges behind the sternal manubrium. The larynx was deviated towards the right side. The total thyroidectomy was performed in two steps: initially a right lobo-isthmectomy, then the left lobectomy. The retrosternal part of the goiter was released using the finger by the same incision. Both recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) were not identified because of the hemorrhage. One parathyroid gland was accidently devascularized and was autotransplanted to the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. The operation was finished by double aspiration drainage. In the first hours after surgery, the patient developed a large cervical hematoma. She was readmitted to the operating room, and after evacuation of the hematoma there was no vessels bleeding. The operation was completed with a double suction drainage. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed hemodynamic collapse requiring the introduction of dobutamine. After 48 hours of hemodynamic support, the blood pressure stabilized and dobutamine was stopped. Histological study concluded in multinodular colloid goiter.

She never suffered from thyroid dysfunction. Her neck was deformed by the voluminous formation classified grade III according to the WHO modified classification. The mass took the front and the two sides of the neck. Its surface was embossed and covered by a thin normal skin. There were some veins of the collateral circulation limited to the neck. The goiter measured 18 x 11 cm. The mass was firm, painless, and mobile with the swallowing movements. Lymphadenopathy research was difficult and found no palpable lymph nodes. The laboratory tests (T 3, T 4 and TSH) were normal. Thoracic radiography showed a large cervical opacity roughly round and strewn with microcalcifications associated with a right eccentricity of the trachea. Cervical and chest CT revealed the presence of a partially calcified thyroid mass slightly plunging in the anterior mediastinum. It took heterogeneously the contrast and then evocate a large MNG. The trachea was surrounded by the goiter, slightly narrowed and right deviated as well as the lower part of the larynx. The right and left vascular axes of the neck (carotid artery and jugular vein) were deviated backward. The patient underwent a surgery for her enormous MNG slightly plunging in the mediastinum. Endotracheal intubation was relatively easy by the laryngoscope. The incision performed was a Kocher cervicotomy. There was a multinodular, hypervascularized goiter. Its lower end plunges behind the sternal manubrium. The larynx was deviated towards the right side. The total thyroidectomy was performed in two steps: initially a right lobo-isthmectomy, then the left lobectomy. The retrosternal part of the goiter was released using the finger by the same incision. Both recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) were not identified because of the hemorrhage. One parathyroid gland was accidently devascularized and was autotransplanted to the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. The operation was finished by double aspiration drainage. In the first hours after surgery, the patient developed a large cervical hematoma. She was readmitted to the operating room, and after evacuation of the hematoma there was no vessels bleeding.

He had presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain consistent with prior episodes of renal colic. Computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of renal calculi that passed with conservative management. An incidental finding on the imaging showed marked pancreatic atrophy with multiple sub-centimeter calcifications consistent with severe chronic pancreatitis. Remarkably, he did not report having any symptoms associated with pancreatic insufficiency including epigastric pain, vomiting, steatorrhea and weight loss. He denied having any prior episodes of acute pancreatitis and had no history of alcohol use. His laboratory tests were all within normal range, including complete blood count, liver function tests, amylase and lipase. His family history was significant as his father had an isolated episode of pancreatitis which required abdominal surgery. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed severe parenchymal atrophy and pancreatic ductal stones with ductal dilation to 9mm. Due to his young age and atypical presentation, he was referred for genetic testing and counselling. He underwent genetic testing for various genes known to cause hereditary pancreatitis: CASR, CFTR, CTRC, PRSS1, SPINK1. He tested positive for homozygous variant of SPINK1 (N34S) mutation. Reflex testing of at-risk relatives confirmed that both of his parents were heterozygous carriers of the same SPINK1 (N34S) mutation and a review of their extended pedigree revealed that they were distant cousins. Given his asymptomatic clinical course, he remains under close follow-up without requiring any specific treatment for pancreatic insufficiency. Due to the severity of pancreatitis noted on imaging and long expected lifespan, he was counselled about the increased risk of pancreatic malignancy and is undergoing regular cross-sectional imaging for the detection and prevention of cancer.

On admission, blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg, her rate was 80 /mn and body temperature was 37°C. The physical examination showed only abdominal distension related to the important ascites without collateral venous circulation. She had no skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly and lower extremities showed no edema. Laboratory investigations showed: leucopenia with white blood cell count = 3100/mm3, lymphopenia = 840/mm3, hemoglobin = 10.5g/dL ; low serum albumin level = 29g/L, 47;-globulin = 19g/L. blood glucose levels = 180 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c = 8.6 %. Urine analysis showed trace protein (0.03g/24h). Platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, erythrocyte sediment rate and total cholesterol were within normal limits. Tests for HBsAg and HCV were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography showed ascitic fluid without any sign of bowel loop thickening or enteritis. Neither lymphadenopathy nor liver abnormality was present. A chest X-ray film disclosed bilateral pleural effusion. Ascitic obtained by aspiration contained 170 cells mm3 (67% lymphocytes), 46g/L protein, but no malignant cells. Cultures for bacteria and mycobacteria gave no growth. Tuberculosis investigation including initial tuberculin skin test and the research of Koch bacilli in sputum and urine were negative. Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were normal. Computed tomographic scan showed massive ascites, no dysmorphic liver, and a mild bilateral pleural effusion. Pelvic examination was normal. Oesogastroduodenoscopy showed hiatal hernia without oesophageal varices. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed, revealing a large amount of ascite, a normal liver appearance, and no granulations suggesting tuberculosis or peritoneal carcinosis. Histological examination of the peritoneum showed non specific chronic inflammation. Systemic lupus erythematosus was suspected based on pleuritis, lymphopenia and leucopenia. An additional serologic survey revealed markedly elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1/1600 and a significantly elevated titer of antibody to double-stranded DNA (83 IU/mL ; normal < 30 IU/mL). She had also positive serum antibody against the Smith antigen and low serum level of C3 complement component: 67 mg/dL (serum normal range: 84 – 151). Relying on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SLE since 4 of the 11 diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were met. The SLEDAI score according to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index was estimated to be 7 on admission. Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily in combination with diuretics was initiated. One month later, there was no detectable ascitic fluid and no pleural effusions. Five months later she remained free from symptoms while continuing to take Hydroxychloroquine

Laboratory investigations showed: leucopenia with white blood cell count = 3100/mm3, lymphopenia = 840/mm3, hemoglobin = 10.5g/dL ; low serum albumin level = 29g/L, 47;-globulin = 19g/L. blood glucose levels = 180 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c = 8.6 %. Urine analysis showed trace protein (0.03g/24h). Platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, erythrocyte sediment rate and total cholesterol were within normal limits. Tests for HBsAg and HCV were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography showed ascitic fluid without any sign of bowel loop thickening or enteritis. Neither lymphadenopathy nor liver abnormality was present. A chest X-ray film disclosed bilateral pleural effusion. Ascitic obtained by aspiration contained 170 cells mm3 (67% lymphocytes), 46g/L protein, but no malignant cells. Cultures for bacteria and mycobacteria gave no growth. Tuberculosis investigation including initial tuberculin skin test and the research of Koch bacilli in sputum and urine were negative. Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were normal. Computed tomographic scan showed massive ascites, no dysmorphic liver, and a mild bilateral pleural effusion. Pelvic examination was normal. Oesogastroduodenoscopy showed hiatal hernia without oesophageal varices. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed, revealing a large amount of ascite, a normal liver appearance, and no granulations suggesting tuberculosis or peritoneal carcinosis. Histological examination of the peritoneum showed non specific chronic inflammation. Systemic lupus erythematosus was suspected based on pleuritis, lymphopenia and leucopenia. An additional serologic survey revealed markedly elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1/1600 and a significantly elevated titer of antibody to double-stranded DNA (83 IU/mL ; normal < 30 IU/mL). She had also positive serum antibody against the Smith antigen and low serum level of C3 complement component: 67 mg/dL (serum normal range: 84 – 151). Relying on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SLE since 4 of the 11 diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were met. The SLEDAI score according to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index was estimated to be 7 on admission. Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily in combination with diuretics was initiated. One month later, there was no detectable ascitic fluid and no pleural effusions. Five months later she remained free from symptoms while continuing to take Hydroxychloroquine

An exploratory laparoscopy was performed, revealing a large amount of ascite, a normal liver appearance, and no granulations suggesting tuberculosis or peritoneal carcinosis. Histological examination of the peritoneum showed non specific chronic inflammation. Systemic lupus erythematosus was suspected based on pleuritis, lymphopenia and leucopenia. An additional serologic survey revealed markedly elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1/1600 and a significantly elevated titer of antibody to double-stranded DNA (83 IU/mL ; normal < 30 IU/mL). She had also positive serum antibody against the Smith antigen and low serum level of C3 complement component: 67 mg/dL (serum normal range: 84 – 151). Relying on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SLE since 4 of the 11 diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were met. The SLEDAI score according to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index was estimated to be 7 on admission. Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily in combination with diuretics was initiated. One month later, there was no detectable ascitic fluid and no pleural effusions. Five months later she remained free from symptoms while continuing to take Hydroxychloroquine

Her family history did not include any autoimmune disease. She denied a history of hepatitis, jaundice or alcohol use. She had a history of diabetes, hypertension treated by glinide and calcium blocker. She was explored 4 years prior to admission for exudative pleuritis of the right lung without any established diagnosis after multiple explorations including thoracoscopy with biopsies. On admission, blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg, her rate was 80 /mn and body temperature was 37°C. The physical examination showed only abdominal distension related to the important ascites without collateral venous circulation. She had no skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly and lower extremities showed no edema. Laboratory investigations showed: leucopenia with white blood cell count = 3100/mm3, lymphopenia = 840/mm3, hemoglobin = 10.5g/dL ; low serum albumin level = 29g/L, 47;-globulin = 19g/L. blood glucose levels = 180 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c = 8.6 %. Urine analysis showed trace protein (0.03g/24h). Platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, erythrocyte sediment rate and total cholesterol were within normal limits. Tests for HBsAg and HCV were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography showed ascitic fluid without any sign of bowel loop thickening or enteritis. Neither lymphadenopathy nor liver abnormality was present. A chest X-ray film disclosed bilateral pleural effusion. Ascitic obtained by aspiration contained 170 cells mm3 (67% lymphocytes), 46g/L protein, but no malignant cells. Cultures for bacteria and mycobacteria gave no growth. Tuberculosis investigation including initial tuberculin skin test and the research of Koch bacilli in sputum and urine were negative. Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were normal. Computed tomographic scan showed massive ascites, no dysmorphic liver, and a mild bilateral pleural effusion. Pelvic examination was normal. Oesogastroduodenoscopy showed hiatal hernia without oesophageal varices. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed, revealing a large amount of ascite, a normal liver appearance, and no granulations suggesting tuberculosis or peritoneal carcinosis. Histological examination of the peritoneum showed non specific chronic inflammation. Systemic lupus erythematosus was suspected based on pleuritis, lymphopenia and leucopenia. An additional serologic survey revealed markedly elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1/1600 and a significantly elevated titer of antibody to double-stranded DNA (83 IU/mL ; normal < 30 IU/mL). She had also positive serum antibody against the Smith antigen and low serum level of C3 complement component: 67 mg/dL (serum normal range: 84 – 151). Relying on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SLE since 4 of the 11 diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were met. The SLEDAI score according to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index was estimated to be 7 on admission. Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily in combination with diuretics was initiated.

The swelling was associated with a high grade fever which was constant and only partially relieved by analgesics. These symptoms were not associated with vomiting, constipation, yellow eyes, loss of appetite or weight loss. The patient reported a history of falling from a tree during one of the nodding episodes in October 2012 and hit his abdomen onto a tree branch. On further probe on his childhood history, his mother reported that he was born normally at home by a Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) in one of the Internally Displaced peoples (IDP) camps in 2000. She reported that there was an uneventful pregnancy which was carried to term and delivery by Spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD). She reported that during her pregnancy, she had exclusive feeding on the relief food provided by WFP (beans, yellow posho and cooking oil) during the IDP camps and denies history of ingestion of herbs or medications which caused adverse events during and after the pregnancy. She reported that her child had a normal physical, cognitive and social childhood development before the onset of nodding which began in May 27th 2011 immediately after returning home from IDP camps. The child was enrolled in Atanga treatment centre and was being managed with Carbamazepine, multivitamins and Ivermectin. She reported that in spite of these medications the child continued to have seizures and nodding at least twice a day and had since dropped out of school. On general examination, he was dehydrated, febrile and moderately wasted. There was a right lumbar region mass, tender, indurated and non-fluctuant. The spleen and liver were not palpable. There was no renal or supra-pubic tenderness. The rectum was full of faecal material which was of normal colour and consistency. The anal tone was normal and there was no blood on examining fingure. Haematological investigations were conducted and showed neutrophilia, lympocytosis, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. There were immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral film report. Other laboratory results including liver function tests (ALT, AST) were elevated while serum protein levels were low; renal functions tests (serum creatinine, blood urea and nitrogen level), and serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Cl-, HC03-) which were within normal ranges. Abdominal Ultrasound showed inflamed internal and external oblique muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The patient underwent incision and drainage at Gulu Hospital and wound left open for 14 days and thereafter secondary wound closure was conducted. He received supplementary food rehabilitation and his seizure medication was changed to Sodium Valproate 200mg once a day under direct observation therapy (DOTS) and close monitoring of the vital signs. The patient continued to have regular follow up in the surgical ward; seizures and nodding stopped completely from the time of intervention in the hospital. With these interventions for over one month the child had no seizures nor nodding and the child returned to normal life. A subsequent review of the haematological and clinical chemistry findings 2 weeks later showed that renal function tests, serum electrolytes were normal except the liver enzymes level were elevated and were still high.

The swelling was associated with a high grade fever which was constant and only partially relieved by analgesics. These symptoms were not associated with vomiting, constipation, yellow eyes, loss of appetite or weight loss. The patient reported a history of falling from a tree during one of the nodding episodes in October 2012 and hit his abdomen onto a tree branch. On further probe on his childhood history, his mother reported that he was born normally at home by a Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) in one of the Internally Displaced peoples (IDP) camps in 2000. She reported that there was an uneventful pregnancy which was carried to term and delivery by Spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD). She reported that during her pregnancy, she had exclusive feeding on the relief food provided by WFP (beans, yellow posho and cooking oil) during the IDP camps and denies history of ingestion of herbs or medications which caused adverse events during and after the pregnancy. She reported that her child had a normal physical, cognitive and social childhood development before the onset of nodding which began in May 27th 2011 immediately after returning home from IDP camps. The child was enrolled in Atanga treatment centre and was being managed with Carbamazepine, multivitamins and Ivermectin. She reported that in spite of these medications the child continued to have seizures and nodding at least twice a day and had since dropped out of school. On general examination, he was dehydrated, febrile and moderately wasted. There was a right lumbar region mass, tender, indurated and non-fluctuant. The spleen and liver were not palpable. There was no renal or supra-pubic tenderness. The rectum was full of faecal material which was of normal colour and consistency. The anal tone was normal and there was no blood on examining fingure. Haematological investigations were conducted and showed neutrophilia, lympocytosis, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. There were immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral film report. Other laboratory results including liver function tests (ALT, AST) were elevated while serum protein levels were low; renal functions tests (serum creatinine, blood urea and nitrogen level), and serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Cl-, HC03-) which were within normal ranges. Abdominal Ultrasound showed inflamed internal and external oblique muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The patient underwent incision and drainage at Gulu Hospital and wound left open for 14 days and thereafter secondary wound closure was conducted. He received supplementary food rehabilitation and his seizure medication was changed to Sodium Valproate 200mg once a day under direct observation therapy (DOTS) and close monitoring of the vital signs. The patient continued to have regular follow up in the surgical ward; seizures and nodding stopped completely from the time of intervention in the hospital. With these interventions for over one month the child had no seizures nor nodding and the child returned to normal life.

She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization. She was performed a proteus intelligence test in which she had 75 points and accepted as mildly mentally retarded.

She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis.

Her initial menarche was at the age of 14 years and it is in accordance with the normal growth of a child at her age. The patient had a regular menstrual period of 5-7 days, she replaced the pads for 2-3 times / day, and had no menstrual pain. The patient has a history of injective contraceptive that was done every once a month in 2010, and after the injection, she menstruated for two months and then it stopped. Based on clinical examination and a physical examination, the patient was diagnosed with secondary amenorrhea. Investigations that were used are ultrasonography, thorax X-ray and CT Scan Head. Ultrasonography and thorax X-Ray showed that patient is suspected to have right pleural effusion. CT-Scan examination showed that bilateral ethmoidal sinusitis and pituitary gland was within normal limits. The treatment plan in this patient is P test therapy with Prothyra 1x10 mg for 7 days, with control on 2 weeks after the use. P test showed a negative result, because after 14 days of progesterone consumption the prothyra is not bleeding. The treatment is followed by a E+P test (Estrogen+Progesterone) with Estrogen 1x0.625 mg for 21 days and an addition of Progesterone 1x10 mg on 12th -21st days, while the control was performed one week after the drug runs out. Based on the E+P test, the obtained results were FSH: 8.71 MIU/mL, LH: 3.1 IU/L, Prolactin: 319.4 ng/mL. The E+P test showed a negative result, so it was necessary to do hysteroscopy and curettage for the uterus evaluation. Hysteroscopy results showed that there were grade 4 adhesions in the uterine cavum, with a pale colored connective tissue in the uterine cavum, which refers to the diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea suspect tuberculosis endometritis, while the result of tissue curettage was examined on the Anatomical Pathology department. Results of anatomical pathology hysteroscopy showed endometrial tissue with stromal looks granulomas with lymphocytes, histiocytes, epithelioid and Langhans multinucleated giant cells and no malignancy was found in this preparation, which showed that patient's diagnosis is secondary amenorrhea suspected tuberculosis endometritis. Based on the Anatomical Pathology hysteroscopy result, treatment was done by using anti-tuberculosis drug category I (FDC 1X3 tab) for 6 months. Anatomical pathology result through macroscopic observation showed visible network of approximately 0.3 cm and 0.4 cm in diameter with a grayish-white color, while the microscopic observations showed fibromuscular tissue at high cylindrical epithelium with polyps shaped vacuolar, and inflammatory granulomatic and aplastic cells were not found.

The E+P test showed a negative result, so it was necessary to do hysteroscopy and curettage for the uterus evaluation. Hysteroscopy results showed that there were grade 4 adhesions in the uterine cavum, with a pale colored connective tissue in the uterine cavum, which refers to the diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea suspect tuberculosis endometritis, while the result of tissue curettage was examined on the Anatomical Pathology department. Results of anatomical pathology hysteroscopy showed endometrial tissue with stromal looks granulomas with lymphocytes, histiocytes, epithelioid and Langhans multinucleated giant cells and no malignancy was found in this preparation, which showed that patient's diagnosis is secondary amenorrhea suspected tuberculosis endometritis. Based on the Anatomical Pathology hysteroscopy result, treatment was done by using anti-tuberculosis drug category I (FDC 1X3 tab) for 6 months. Anatomical pathology result through macroscopic observation showed visible network of approximately 0.3 cm and 0.4 cm in diameter with a grayish-white color, while the microscopic observations showed fibromuscular tissue at high cylindrical epithelium with polyps shaped vacuolar, and inflammatory granulomatic and aplastic cells were not found.

Her initial menarche was at the age of 14 years and it is in accordance with the normal growth of a child at her age. The patient had a regular menstrual period of 5-7 days, she replaced the pads for 2-3 times / day, and had no menstrual pain. The patient has a history of injective contraceptive that was done every once a month in 2010, and after the injection, she menstruated for two months and then it stopped. Based on clinical examination and a physical examination, the patient was diagnosed with secondary amenorrhea. Investigations that were used are ultrasonography, thorax X-ray and CT Scan Head. Ultrasonography and thorax X-Ray showed that patient is suspected to have right pleural effusion. CT-Scan examination showed that bilateral ethmoidal sinusitis and pituitary gland was within normal limits. The treatment plan in this patient is P test therapy with Prothyra 1x10 mg for 7 days, with control on 2 weeks after the use. P test showed a negative result, because after 14 days of progesterone consumption the prothyra is not bleeding. The treatment is followed by a E+P test (Estrogen+Progesterone) with Estrogen 1x0.625 mg for 21 days and an addition of Progesterone 1x10 mg on 12th -21st days, while the control was performed one week after the drug runs out. Based on the E+P test, the obtained results were FSH: 8.71 MIU/mL, LH: 3.1 IU/L, Prolactin: 319.4 ng/mL. The E+P test showed a negative result, so it was necessary to do hysteroscopy and curettage for the uterus evaluation. Hysteroscopy results showed that there were grade 4 adhesions in the uterine cavum, with a pale colored connective tissue in the uterine cavum, which refers to the diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea suspect tuberculosis endometritis, while the result of tissue curettage was examined on the Anatomical Pathology department. Results of anatomical pathology hysteroscopy showed endometrial tissue with stromal looks granulomas with lymphocytes, histiocytes, epithelioid and Langhans multinucleated giant cells and no malignancy was found in this preparation, which showed that patient's diagnosis is secondary amenorrhea suspected tuberculosis endometritis.

Anatomical pathology result through macroscopic observation showed visible network of approximately 0.3 cm and 0.4 cm in diameter with a grayish-white color, while the microscopic observations showed fibromuscular tissue at high cylindrical epithelium with polyps shaped vacuolar, and inflammatory granulomatic and aplastic cells were not found.

Her past medical history showed a nonsmoking history and no significant family history. The physical examination was unremarkable. She was treated as urinary tract infection, but there was no improvement in her symptoms. Urine analysis and culture were performed several times that was negative for infection. Other laboratory data were also insignificant. Through a routine evaluation, urinary system ultrasonography (US) revealed a bladder lesion measuring 7 mm. In order to confirm the diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvic cavity was done; it revealed a lesion in the dome of the bladder. To confirm the diagnosis and for histopathological examination, the patient underwent Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) in April 2018. Before starting the procedure, the urethra was dilated till Fr: 28; at first, the tumor location was specified by cystoscopy.

Then, it was resected by monopolar cautery from superficial to deeper parts with removal of the muscle layers. Proper bleeders were taken and three way Foley catheter was applied for a continuous irrigation. The patient was transferred to the recovery room with complete stability. The histopathology slides show a well-defined mass composed of bland looking spindle cells. Subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done which showed diffuse immunoreactivity for S100, but other markers including smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, cytokeratin, CD34 and beta catenin were negative. Ki67 was 2-3%, so the diagnosis of schwannoma was confirmed. Then, the neck, abdomen, pelvic and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were done that were normal. Brain and spine MRI and physical examination showed no evidence of other schwannoma or evidence of neurofibromatosis. She had no history of neurofibromatosis in her family. Skin examination was normal and had no café au lait spot. She was not a case of von Recklinghausen disease.

In order to confirm the diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvic cavity was done; it revealed a lesion in the dome of the bladder. To confirm the diagnosis and for histopathological examination, the patient underwent Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) in April 2018. Before starting the procedure, the urethra was dilated till Fr: 28; at first, the tumor location was specified by cystoscopy. Then, it was resected by monopolar cautery from superficial to deeper parts with removal of the muscle layers. Proper bleeders were taken and three way Foley catheter was applied for a continuous irrigation. The patient was transferred to the recovery room with complete stability. The histopathology slides show a well-defined mass composed of bland looking spindle cells. Subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done which showed diffuse immunoreactivity for S100, but other markers including smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, cytokeratin, CD34 and beta catenin were negative. Ki67 was 2-3%, so the diagnosis of schwannoma was confirmed. Then, the neck, abdomen, pelvic and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were done that were normal. Brain and spine MRI and physical examination showed no evidence of other schwannoma or evidence of neurofibromatosis. She had no history of neurofibromatosis in her family. Skin examination was normal and had no café au lait spot. She was not a case of von Recklinghausen disease.

He acquired full-and partial-thickness injury in approximately 38% of his TBSA, including face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), and most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%). The patient was hospitalized for 66 days and underwent five debridement surgeries. The psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3, treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. The patient was occasionally restrained due to rebellious and self-destruction behavior. The nutrition management of this patient was started after a week of hospitalization, which is considered late. In the initial nutrition assessment, the patient was 40 kg weight and 150 cm tall thus the body mass index (BMI) was 17,57 kg/m 2 or underweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were not found. Information regarding the patient's dietary intake in the last two weeks and weight change within the last 6 months could not be obtained, but his mother claimed that the patient seemed to lose weight because he refused any food that had been offered to him; he only smoked and drank coffee. Albumin level was 3.6 gr/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels. Signs of fluid accumulation were not found. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient belonged to group C (severely malnourished). Energy and protein were given starting from 30 kcal/kg, increasing gradually to 50 kcal/kg, and 2 gp/kg divided into oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with a 50:50 ratio. The patient was also given micronutrient supplementations, specifically vitamin A 100,000 units for the first week, vitamin C 100 mg 3 times a day, and zinc 20 mg once a day. During the early weeks of hospitalization, the patient's weight loss continued. At the end of the second week, his body weight was 36 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.7 gr/L. On the 28 th day, the patient's body weight was 33 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.1 gr/L. Energy and protein intake was maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30. During the treatment, the patient's appetite was unstable. The patient was also hardly cooperative with enteral access. The patient often writhed in pain and became more aggressive. The patient did not respond well to analgesics and sedations. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs. However, his BMI continued to decline, and on the 42 nd day, his body weight dropped to 32 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2 gr/L. On the 66 th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the mental and nutrition status of the patient, it was decided not to continue with the skin graft surgery. The patient had lost 24% of body weight (BMI 11.96 kg/m 2) and the serum albumin level was 2.5 gr/L. The patient displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. However, the general and mental condition was relatively better. The patient was discharged from the hospital.

He acquired full-and partial-thickness injury in approximately 38% of his TBSA, including face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), and most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%). The patient was hospitalized for 66 days and underwent five debridement surgeries. The psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3, treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. The patient was occasionally restrained due to rebellious and self-destruction behavior. The nutrition management of this patient was started after a week of hospitalization, which is considered late. In the initial nutrition assessment, the patient was 40 kg weight and 150 cm tall thus the body mass index (BMI) was 17,57 kg/m 2 or underweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were not found. Information regarding the patient's dietary intake in the last two weeks and weight change within the last 6 months could not be obtained, but his mother claimed that the patient seemed to lose weight because he refused any food that had been offered to him; he only smoked and drank coffee. Albumin level was 3.6 gr/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels. Signs of fluid accumulation were not found. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient belonged to group C (severely malnourished). Energy and protein were given starting from 30 kcal/kg, increasing gradually to 50 kcal/kg, and 2 gp/kg divided into oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with a 50:50 ratio. The patient was also given micronutrient supplementations, specifically vitamin A 100,000 units for the first week, vitamin C 100 mg 3 times a day, and zinc 20 mg once a day. During the early weeks of hospitalization, the patient's weight loss continued. At the end of the second week, his body weight was 36 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.7 gr/L. On the 28 th day, the patient's body weight was 33 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.1 gr/L. Energy and protein intake was maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30. During the treatment, the patient's appetite was unstable. The patient was also hardly cooperative with enteral access. The patient often writhed in pain and became more aggressive. The patient did not respond well to analgesics and sedations. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs. However, his BMI continued to decline, and on the 42 nd day, his body weight dropped to 32 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2 gr/L. On the 66 th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the mental and nutrition status of the patient, it was decided not to continue with the skin graft surgery.

He acquired full-and partial-thickness injury in approximately 38% of his TBSA, including face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), and most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%). The patient was hospitalized for 66 days and underwent five debridement surgeries. The psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3, treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. The patient was occasionally restrained due to rebellious and self-destruction behavior. The nutrition management of this patient was started after a week of hospitalization, which is considered late. In the initial nutrition assessment, the patient was 40 kg weight and 150 cm tall thus the body mass index (BMI) was 17,57 kg/m 2 or underweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were not found. Information regarding the patient's dietary intake in the last two weeks and weight change within the last 6 months could not be obtained, but his mother claimed that the patient seemed to lose weight because he refused any food that had been offered to him; he only smoked and drank coffee. Albumin level was 3.6 gr/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels. Signs of fluid accumulation were not found. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient belonged to group C (severely malnourished). Energy and protein were given starting from 30 kcal/kg, increasing gradually to 50 kcal/kg, and 2 gp/kg divided into oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with a 50:50 ratio. The patient was also given micronutrient supplementations, specifically vitamin A 100,000 units for the first week, vitamin C 100 mg 3 times a day, and zinc 20 mg once a day. During the early weeks of hospitalization, the patient's weight loss continued. At the end of the second week, his body weight was 36 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.7 gr/L. On the 28 th day, the patient's body weight was 33 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.1 gr/L. Energy and protein intake was maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30. During the treatment, the patient's appetite was unstable. The patient was also hardly cooperative with enteral access. The patient often writhed in pain and became more aggressive. The patient did not respond well to analgesics and sedations. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs. However, his BMI continued to decline, and on the 42 nd day, his body weight dropped to 32 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2 gr/L. On the 66 th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the mental and nutrition status of the patient, it was decided not to continue with the skin graft surgery. The patient had lost 24% of body weight (BMI 11.96 kg/m 2) and the serum albumin level was 2.5 gr/L. The patient displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. However, the general and mental condition was relatively better. The patient was discharged from the hospital.

He acquired full-and partial-thickness injury in approximately 38% of his TBSA, including face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), and most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%). The patient was hospitalized for 66 days and underwent five debridement surgeries. The psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3, treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. The patient was occasionally restrained due to rebellious and self-destruction behavior. The nutrition management of this patient was started after a week of hospitalization, which is considered late. In the initial nutrition assessment, the patient was 40 kg weight and 150 cm tall thus the body mass index (BMI) was 17,57 kg/m 2 or underweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were not found. Information regarding the patient's dietary intake in the last two weeks and weight change within the last 6 months could not be obtained, but his mother claimed that the patient seemed to lose weight because he refused any food that had been offered to him; he only smoked and drank coffee. Albumin level was 3.6 gr/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels. Signs of fluid accumulation were not found. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient belonged to group C (severely malnourished). Energy and protein were given starting from 30 kcal/kg, increasing gradually to 50 kcal/kg, and 2 gp/kg divided into oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with a 50:50 ratio. The patient was also given micronutrient supplementations, specifically vitamin A 100,000 units for the first week, vitamin C 100 mg 3 times a day, and zinc 20 mg once a day. During the early weeks of hospitalization, the patient's weight loss continued. At the end of the second week, his body weight was 36 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.7 gr/L. On the 28 th day, the patient's body weight was 33 kilograms while his serum albumin level was 2.1 gr/L. Energy and protein intake was maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30. During the treatment, the patient's appetite was unstable. The patient was also hardly cooperative with enteral access. The patient often writhed in pain and became more aggressive. The patient did not respond well to analgesics and sedations. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs.

The swelling was slowly progressive, associated with pain. However, the patient did not refer any motor or sensory deficit. There was no family history of similar swelling.
Physical examination revealed a left maxillary swelling. There was no facial palsy. No cervical lymph node enlargement was seen. The oral examination showed a 4 cm x 5 cm, tender, compressible mass in the left maxilla, from the lateral incisor to the second premolar teeth. The tumor surface was smooth and red-purple. Several teeth were involved and displaced in the tumor mass. We noted the absence of canine. Vitality tests proved negative on the central and lateral incisor. Hight mobility of lateral incisor was noted. Orthopantomography and occlusal radiography showed a wide osteolytic area of the anterior left maxilla, extending from the first permanent molar to the central incisor. The canine was impacted. No root resorption was observed. The radiolucency was closely related to maxillary sinus and involving the nasal cavity. Haematological investigations showed normal serum calcium, phosphorus and parathormone (PTH) levels. The provisional diagnosis of benign tumor of the maxilla was made.
The patient underwent excision and curettage of the mass with extraction of the canine and lateral incisor tooth. The wound was closed with interrupted sutures. The post-operative histopathological report revealed multinuclear giant cells scattered randomly throughout the cellular and fibrous vascular-rich tissue. New bone formation and granulation tissue rich in mononuclear inflammatory cells was revealed. The giant cells were multinucleated with bland-appearing nuclei, and the background stromal cells displayed no evidence of atypical mitoses. A diagnosis of giant cell tumor was established.
During a 1-year serial clinical and radiological follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence. The facial contour and masticatory function were well-preserved.

He also complained of breathlessness on exertion and had two episodes of blood in his sputum. The patient explained that the cough was continuous and was relieved after taking cough syrup. He also mentioned that the episodes of fever were initially intermittent and then daily for the last two weeks and were relieved after taking Paracetamol. The chest pain was localized to the middle of the chest and was aggravated on exertion. He was a businessman by profession with no history of smoking, alcoholism, or any other substance abuse. Also, there was no history of any contact of TB or COVID-19 in the family or close contacts. And there was no history of foreign travel in the recent past. But he had reported having traveled by a domestic airline about twenty days back. There was no history of weight loss or any other major illness in the past.
On examination his vitals were-pulse-108/minute, arterial BP-130/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, Sp02-899% on room air, temperature- 101-degree centigrade. His Sp02 fell by 70% on room air after waking. On auscultation, there was crepitation on the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs. Also, dyspnea on exertion was noted. The rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits.
Considering this as a probable case of TB with COVID-19 he was advised a chest radiograph with sputum microscopy (Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining for acid-fast bacilli), Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) of the sputum and other routine investigations. To check for the COVID-19 he was advised qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from the oropharyngeal swab. The results were surprising with Mycobacterium tuberculosis detected on sputum fluorescent microscopy and were also confirmed by the CBNAAT. However, there was no resistance to Rifampicin. The results of the PCR were positive for RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the chest radiograph PA-view was suggestive of bilateral consolidations on the middle lobes of lungs with ill-defined borders. The other investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count (1x 10 9 /L) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (57 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (580 U/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm in the 1 st hour). Also, a sample for liquid culture (MGIT BACTEC) was sent to the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) which revealed the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was established by other cheaper and faster methods and also the patient was unwilling for the same. All the other routine investigations were within normal limits.
He was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center, where he was managed as per national guidelines. Besides, he was also started on an antitubercular treatment of four drugs as per the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines. He was advised follow-up post completion of his stay at the designated COVID-19 center, but he has not yet reported back for follow-up. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for using clinical data and images for publication in this study.

Besides, the chest radiograph PA-view was suggestive of bilateral consolidations on the middle lobes of lungs with ill-defined borders. The other investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count (1x 10 9 /L) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (57 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (580 U/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm in the 1 st hour). Also, a sample for liquid culture (MGIT BACTEC) was sent to the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) which revealed the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was established by other cheaper and faster methods and also the patient was unwilling for the same. All the other routine investigations were within normal limits.
He was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center, where he was managed as per national guidelines. Besides, he was also started on an antitubercular treatment of four drugs as per the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines.

He also complained of breathlessness on exertion and had two episodes of blood in his sputum. The patient explained that the cough was continuous and was relieved after taking cough syrup. He also mentioned that the episodes of fever were initially intermittent and then daily for the last two weeks and were relieved after taking Paracetamol. The chest pain was localized to the middle of the chest and was aggravated on exertion. He was a businessman by profession with no history of smoking, alcoholism, or any other substance abuse. Also, there was no history of any contact of TB or COVID-19 in the family or close contacts. And there was no history of foreign travel in the recent past. But he had reported having traveled by a domestic airline about twenty days back. There was no history of weight loss or any other major illness in the past.
On examination his vitals were-pulse-108/minute, arterial BP-130/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, Sp02-899% on room air, temperature- 101-degree centigrade. His Sp02 fell by 70% on room air after waking. On auscultation, there was crepitation on the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs. Also, dyspnea on exertion was noted.

 {'id': '10158', 'offsets': array([42, 81]), 'role': '', 'semantic_type_id': '', 'text': 'the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs', 'type': 'BODYPART'}]","A 43-year-old non-diabetic Indian male reported to our outpatient department with chief complaints of cough with expectoration, chest pain, reduced appetite, fever with chills, and night sweats for two weeks. He also complained of breathlessness on exertion and had two episodes of blood in his sputum. The patient explained that the cough was continuous and was relieved after taking cough syrup. He also mentioned that the episodes of fever were initially intermittent and then daily for the last two weeks and were relieved after taking Paracetamol. The chest pain was localized to the middle of the chest and was aggravated on exertion. He was a businessman by profession with no history of smoking, alcoholism, or any other substance abuse. Also, there was no history of any contact of TB or COVID-19 in the family or close contacts. And there was no history of foreign travel in the recent past. But he had reported having traveled by a domestic airline about twenty days back. There was no history of weight loss or any other major illness in the past.
On examination his vitals were-pulse-108/minute, arterial BP-130/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, Sp02-899% on room air, temperature- 101-degree centigrade. His Sp02 fell by 70% on room air after waking. On auscultation, there was crepitation on the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs. Also, dyspnea on exertion was noted. The rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits.
Considering this as a probable case of TB with COVID-19 he was advised a chest radiograph with sputum microscopy (Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining for acid-fast bacilli), Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) of the sputum and other routine investigations. To check for the COVID-19 he was advised qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from the oropharyngeal swab. The results were surprising with Mycobacterium tuberculosis detected on sputum fluorescent microscopy and were also confirmed by the CBNAAT. However, there was no resistance to Rifampicin. The results of the PCR were positive for RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the chest radiograph PA-view was suggestive of bilateral consolidations on the middle lobes of lungs with ill-defined borders. The other investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count (1x 10 9 /L) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (57 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (580 U/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm in the 1 st hour). Also, a sample for liquid culture (MGIT BACTEC) was sent to the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) which revealed the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was established by other cheaper and faster methods and also the patient was unwilling for the same. All the other routine investigations were within normal limits.
He was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center, where he was managed as per national guidelines. Besides, he was also started on an antitubercular treatment of four drugs as per the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines. He was advised follow-up post completion of his stay at the designated COVID-19 center, but he has not yet reported back for follow-up. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for using clinical data and images for publication in this study.

"However, there was no resistance to Rifampicin.","[{'id': '9455', 'offsets': array([22, 32]), 'role': '', 'semantic_type_id': '', 'text': 'resistance', 'type': 'EVENT'}]","A 43-year-old non-diabetic Indian male reported to our outpatient department with chief complaints of cough with expectoration, chest pain, reduced appetite, fever with chills, and night sweats for two weeks. He also complained of breathlessness on exertion and had two episodes of blood in his sputum. The patient explained that the cough was continuous and was relieved after taking cough syrup. He also mentioned that the episodes of fever were initially intermittent and then daily for the last two weeks and were relieved after taking Paracetamol. The chest pain was localized to the middle of the chest and was aggravated on exertion. He was a businessman by profession with no history of smoking, alcoholism, or any other substance abuse. Also, there was no history of any contact of TB or COVID-19 in the family or close contacts. And there was no history of foreign travel in the recent past. But he had reported having traveled by a domestic airline about twenty days back. There was no history of weight loss or any other major illness in the past.
On examination his vitals were-pulse-108/minute, arterial BP-130/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, Sp02-899% on room air, temperature- 101-degree centigrade. His Sp02 fell by 70% on room air after waking. On auscultation, there was crepitation on the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs. Also, dyspnea on exertion was noted. The rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits.
Considering this as a probable case of TB with COVID-19 he was advised a chest radiograph with sputum microscopy (Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining for acid-fast bacilli), Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) of the sputum and other routine investigations. To check for the COVID-19 he was advised qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from the oropharyngeal swab. The results were surprising with Mycobacterium tuberculosis detected on sputum fluorescent microscopy and were also confirmed by the CBNAAT. However, there was no resistance to Rifampicin. The results of the PCR were positive for RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the chest radiograph PA-view was suggestive of bilateral consolidations on the middle lobes of lungs with ill-defined borders. The other investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count (1x 10 9 /L) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (57 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (580 U/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm in the 1 st hour). Also, a sample for liquid culture (MGIT BACTEC) was sent to the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) which revealed the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was established by other cheaper and faster methods and also the patient was unwilling for the same. All the other routine investigations were within normal limits.
He was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center, where he was managed as per national guidelines. Besides, he was also started on an antitubercular treatment of four drugs as per the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines. He was advised follow-up post completion of his stay at the designated COVID-19 center, but he has not yet reported back for follow-up.

The results of the PCR were positive for RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the chest radiograph PA-view was suggestive of bilateral consolidations on the middle lobes of lungs with ill-defined borders. The other investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count (1x 10 9 /L) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (57 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (580 U/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm in the 1 st hour). Also, a sample for liquid culture (MGIT BACTEC) was sent to the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) which revealed the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was established by other cheaper and faster methods and also the patient was unwilling for the same. All the other routine investigations were within normal limits.
He was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center, where he was managed as per national guidelines. Besides, he was also started on an antitubercular treatment of four drugs as per the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines. He was advised follow-up post completion of his stay at the designated COVID-19 center, but he has not yet reported back for follow-up.

He also complained of breathlessness on exertion and had two episodes of blood in his sputum. The patient explained that the cough was continuous and was relieved after taking cough syrup. He also mentioned that the episodes of fever were initially intermittent and then daily for the last two weeks and were relieved after taking Paracetamol. The chest pain was localized to the middle of the chest and was aggravated on exertion. He was a businessman by profession with no history of smoking, alcoholism, or any other substance abuse. Also, there was no history of any contact of TB or COVID-19 in the family or close contacts. And there was no history of foreign travel in the recent past. But he had reported having traveled by a domestic airline about twenty days back. There was no history of weight loss or any other major illness in the past.
On examination his vitals were-pulse-108/minute, arterial BP-130/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, Sp02-899% on room air, temperature- 101-degree centigrade. His Sp02 fell by 70% on room air after waking. On auscultation, there was crepitation on the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs. Also, dyspnea on exertion was noted.

He was the third born child to a 27-year-old mother with no significant past history. He was derived from a third degree consanguineous marriage. He was born by means of normal vaginal delivery with a normal extra-uterine adaptation. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted. His birth weight was 3030g (75 th Percentile). The baby had normal physical examination at birth aside transitory respiratory distress. He had been hospitalized for four days in a private clinic, for the suspicion of materno-foetal infection, where he had antibiotics for 48 hours. He had developed no symptoms during his hospitalization. The output's weight was 2400g which signify the loss of 630g.
Back home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed ""bat wings"" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.
On the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.
The oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern. In the submucosa, there were numerous Brunner glands. We find the existence of numerous hemorrhagic suffusions. The CD10 immunostain was positive. Thus, a diagnosis hypothesis of MVID was raised. The electron microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis.
Mutation analysis of peripheral blood samples of the neonate revealed a mutation at the homozygous status of MYO5B gene.
The baby died, after 97 days of life, of septic shock and multiple organ failure.

He was the third born child to a 27-year-old mother with no significant past history. He was derived from a third degree consanguineous marriage. He was born by means of normal vaginal delivery with a normal extra-uterine adaptation. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted. His birth weight was 3030g (75 th Percentile). The baby had normal physical examination at birth aside transitory respiratory distress. He had been hospitalized for four days in a private clinic, for the suspicion of materno-foetal infection, where he had antibiotics for 48 hours. He had developed no symptoms during his hospitalization. The output's weight was 2400g which signify the loss of 630g.
Back home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed ""bat wings"" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.
On the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.
The oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern. In the submucosa, there were numerous Brunner glands. We find the existence of numerous hemorrhagic suffusions. The CD10 immunostain was positive. Thus, a diagnosis hypothesis of MVID was raised. The electron microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis.
Mutation analysis of peripheral blood samples of the neonate revealed a mutation at the homozygous status of MYO5B gene.

Back home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed ""bat wings"" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.
On the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.
The oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern. In the submucosa, there were numerous Brunner glands. We find the existence of numerous hemorrhagic suffusions. The CD10 immunostain was positive. Thus, a diagnosis hypothesis of MVID was raised. The electron microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis.
Mutation analysis of peripheral blood samples of the neonate revealed a mutation at the homozygous status of MYO5B gene.
The baby died, after 97 days of life, of septic shock and multiple organ failure.

He was the third born child to a 27-year-old mother with no significant past history. He was derived from a third degree consanguineous marriage. He was born by means of normal vaginal delivery with a normal extra-uterine adaptation. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted. His birth weight was 3030g (75 th Percentile). The baby had normal physical examination at birth aside transitory respiratory distress. He had been hospitalized for four days in a private clinic, for the suspicion of materno-foetal infection, where he had antibiotics for 48 hours. He had developed no symptoms during his hospitalization. The output's weight was 2400g which signify the loss of 630g.
Back home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed ""bat wings"" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.
On the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.
The oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern. In the submucosa, there were numerous Brunner glands. We find the existence of numerous hemorrhagic suffusions. The CD10 immunostain was positive. Thus, a diagnosis hypothesis of MVID was raised. The electron microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis.

He was the third born child to a 27-year-old mother with no significant past history. He was derived from a third degree consanguineous marriage. He was born by means of normal vaginal delivery with a normal extra-uterine adaptation. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted. His birth weight was 3030g (75 th Percentile). The baby had normal physical examination at birth aside transitory respiratory distress. He had been hospitalized for four days in a private clinic, for the suspicion of materno-foetal infection, where he had antibiotics for 48 hours. He had developed no symptoms during his hospitalization. The output's weight was 2400g which signify the loss of 630g.
Back home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed ""bat wings"" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.
On the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.
The oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern.

She was doing well on follow up until the completion of fifth year of her disease, when she presented with complaints of mild fever and weakness. Examination revealed generalized lymph node enlargement along with hepatomegaly. Hemogram showed mild anemia, normal platelet count and a leukocyte count of 1.2 x 10(11)/L. Peripheral blood examination revealed medium sized lymphoid cells, constituting almost 75% of total nucleated cell population. Immunophenotying, established a diagnosis of post thymic T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.

She was evaluated by urology and a right partial nephrectomy was planned, however on the day of the procedure, the patient's preoperative pregnancy test was positive. The procedure was post postponed until after she delivered and interval ultrasounds were obtained throughout her pregnancy to monitor the renal mass. The lesion increased minimally in size. Two months after caesarian section delivery, patient underwent an unremarkable right laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with individual artery and vein vascular occlusion at the level of the renal hilum. A superficial liver laceration caused by the Veress needle was noted at the beginning of the procedure and effectively managed using bipolar cautery.
The patient's post-operative course was notable for marked thrombocytosis with her platelet count increasing for her baseline of 300,000 to a zenith of 1.3 million. She was started on aspirin therapy and splenomegaly was noted on abdomen ultrasound. Her platelet count normalized to 334,000. On pathology, the renal mass was classified as a papillary renal neoplasm consistent with a translocation carcinoma. There was no splenic tissue in the specimen. It was noted that the complete lack of staining of any keratins or epithelial membrane antigens was not consistent with a usual renal cell carcinoma and hence the diagnosis of a translocation tumor was made.
The patient was lost to follow up presenting 2 years later and a follow-up CT scan noted marked splenic atrophy with several splenules. The patient was completely asymptomatic and at the time received all the post-splenectomy vaccination and her platelet count remained within normal limits.

The neurovascular examination was normal; in particular no sensitive deficit in the median nerve area was noted. Plain radiographs with front and lateral views showed a dislocation of the three lesser fingers associated with fractures of the hamatum and the second metacarpal.

The physical exam revealed pallor, hepatomegaly, and grade III splenomegaly. The investigation revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC): 545,000/mm³. PNN: 49,050/mm³, hemoglobin: 11.6g/dl, platelets: 328,000/mm³. The patient's peripheral blood smear revealed marked leukocytosis with a significant number of immature myeloid precursors and 21% blasts. The analysis of the BCR-ABL shows 94% in the peripheral blood. The patient was diagnosed with CML. She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of the CSF collected showed lymphoblasts in a WBC count of 11000cells/ml. Flow cytometry of the CSF showed that blast cells were positive for a cluster of differentiation markers (CD) (CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22 and partially positive for CD45) confirming CNS extramedullary lymphoid blast infiltration. A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.
The diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crises (lymphoid type) was based on the presence of blasts in CSF (confirmed by flow cytometry).
The patient received a high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, arabinoside and dexamethasone). The imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at the dose of 100 mg per day. She was treated with 24 Gy of whole-brain radiation therapy.
Allogenic stem cell transplantation was not feasible. We noticed a rapidly progressive amelioration in her neurological status after finishing systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy; however, the patient's visual loss showed no signs of improvement.

She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of the CSF collected showed lymphoblasts in a WBC count of 11000cells/ml. Flow cytometry of the CSF showed that blast cells were positive for a cluster of differentiation markers (CD) (CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22 and partially positive for CD45) confirming CNS extramedullary lymphoid blast infiltration. A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.

She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of the CSF collected showed lymphoblasts in a WBC count of 11000cells/ml. Flow cytometry of the CSF showed that blast cells were positive for a cluster of differentiation markers (CD) (CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22 and partially positive for CD45) confirming CNS extramedullary lymphoid blast infiltration. A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.
The diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crises (lymphoid type) was based on the presence of blasts in CSF (confirmed by flow cytometry).
The patient received a high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, arabinoside and dexamethasone). The imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at the dose of 100 mg per day. She was treated with 24 Gy of whole-brain radiation therapy.
Allogenic stem cell transplantation was not feasible. We noticed a rapidly progressive amelioration in her neurological status after finishing systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy; however, the patient's visual loss showed no signs of improvement.

The physical exam revealed pallor, hepatomegaly, and grade III splenomegaly. The investigation revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC): 545,000/mm³. PNN: 49,050/mm³, hemoglobin: 11.6g/dl, platelets: 328,000/mm³. The patient's peripheral blood smear revealed marked leukocytosis with a significant number of immature myeloid precursors and 21% blasts. The analysis of the BCR-ABL shows 94% in the peripheral blood. The patient was diagnosed with CML. She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of the CSF collected showed lymphoblasts in a WBC count of 11000cells/ml. Flow cytometry of the CSF showed that blast cells were positive for a cluster of differentiation markers (CD) (CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22 and partially positive for CD45) confirming CNS extramedullary lymphoid blast infiltration. A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.
The diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crises (lymphoid type) was based on the presence of blasts in CSF (confirmed by flow cytometry).
The patient received a high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, arabinoside and dexamethasone). The imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at the dose of 100 mg per day. She was treated with 24 Gy of whole-brain radiation therapy.
Allogenic stem cell transplantation was not feasible. We noticed a rapidly progressive amelioration in her neurological status after finishing systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy; however, the patient's visual loss showed no signs of improvement.

A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.
The diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crises (lymphoid type) was based on the presence of blasts in CSF (confirmed by flow cytometry).
The patient received a high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, arabinoside and dexamethasone). The imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at the dose of 100 mg per day. She was treated with 24 Gy of whole-brain radiation therapy.
Allogenic stem cell transplantation was not feasible. We noticed a rapidly progressive amelioration in her neurological status after finishing systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy; however, the patient's visual loss showed no signs of improvement.

The physical exam revealed pallor, hepatomegaly, and grade III splenomegaly. The investigation revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC): 545,000/mm³. PNN: 49,050/mm³, hemoglobin: 11.6g/dl, platelets: 328,000/mm³. The patient's peripheral blood smear revealed marked leukocytosis with a significant number of immature myeloid precursors and 21% blasts. The analysis of the BCR-ABL shows 94% in the peripheral blood. The patient was diagnosed with CML. She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes.

The physical exam revealed pallor, hepatomegaly, and grade III splenomegaly. The investigation revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC): 545,000/mm³. PNN: 49,050/mm³, hemoglobin: 11.6g/dl, platelets: 328,000/mm³. The patient's peripheral blood smear revealed marked leukocytosis with a significant number of immature myeloid precursors and 21% blasts. The analysis of the BCR-ABL shows 94% in the peripheral blood. The patient was diagnosed with CML. She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of the CSF collected showed lymphoblasts in a WBC count of 11000cells/ml. Flow cytometry of the CSF showed that blast cells were positive for a cluster of differentiation markers (CD) (CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22 and partially positive for CD45) confirming CNS extramedullary lymphoid blast infiltration. A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.

First of all, the patient is not smoking and reported an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta surgically treated by prosthesis under plavix. The beginning of the symptomatology goes back to 2 months before with right nasal obstruction of progressive onset, associated with right epistaxis and bloody rhinorrhea with right chronic eye watering. Nasal Endoscopy examination revealed a pinnkish burgeoning mass bleeding on contact and filling the right nostril vestibule. The patient didn't presents neurological signs nor cervical lymph nods. Otherwise, ophthalmologic examination found normal visual acuity and ocular mobility on both sides. Sinonasal computed tomography (CT) found a right nasal process enhanced after injection of contrast product with relatively little washing at the late time. Otherwise, there is no extension involvement at the level of the cavum and the pterygo palate fossa. This finding found also a crenate appearance of the posterior nasal mucosa especially of the middle turbinates and contralateral inferior turbinate with a left deviation of the nasal septum with nasal spur. Nasosinusal MRI shows a progressive increase in size of the tissue mass compared to the previously CT occupying the right nasal fossa on almost all of its height, measuring 4 × 2.8 × 3.5cm without extension within the cavum with probable invasion of the lower part of the nasolacrimal duct and mass effect on both the sinusonasal bone septum and the intersinusonasal septum. This finding shows ethmoidal sinus fluid retention. The appearance, even if it remains unspecific, is compatible with inverted papilloma. The patient underwent complete endoscopic removal of the tumor with ethmoidectomy and right maxillary antrostomy. The extemporaneous examination is in favor of a malignant tumor lesion. Histopathologic analysis shows a tumor proliferation made of polymorphic cells with major anisocytosis, most often located in lobules. There is sometimes a somewhat palisadic seat on the periphery of the tumor mass. The mitotic index is 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields. The immunohistochemical study of the tumor found that the cytokeratin KL1 and CK7 and the neuroendocrine marker Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 are positive. Proliferation index Ki67 is of the order of 80%. Otherwise there is an absence of expression of PS100, MelanA, HMB45, desmin, p40, CD45 and EBV.
The clear positivity of cytokeratins formally excludes the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma and leads to neuroendocrine carcinoma. Given the atypia, the mitotic index, and the Ki67 proliferation index, it is a high-grade large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Extension assessment, comprising a PET SCAN, was negative. Postoperative treatment consisted in adjuvant polychemotherapy, with six cycles (cisplatin and etoposide), Followed by loco regional external radiotherapy. After 6 month follow-up, the patient was in complete clinical and radiological remission.

The patient underwent complete endoscopic removal of the tumor with ethmoidectomy and right maxillary antrostomy. The extemporaneous examination is in favor of a malignant tumor lesion. Histopathologic analysis shows a tumor proliferation made of polymorphic cells with major anisocytosis, most often located in lobules. There is sometimes a somewhat palisadic seat on the periphery of the tumor mass. The mitotic index is 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields. The immunohistochemical study of the tumor found that the cytokeratin KL1 and CK7 and the neuroendocrine marker Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 are positive. Proliferation index Ki67 is of the order of 80%. Otherwise there is an absence of expression of PS100, MelanA, HMB45, desmin, p40, CD45 and EBV.
The clear positivity of cytokeratins formally excludes the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma and leads to neuroendocrine carcinoma. Given the atypia, the mitotic index, and the Ki67 proliferation index, it is a high-grade large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Extension assessment, comprising a PET SCAN, was negative. Postoperative treatment consisted in adjuvant polychemotherapy, with six cycles (cisplatin and etoposide), Followed by loco regional external radiotherapy. After 6 month follow-up, the patient was in complete clinical and radiological remission.

This finding found also a crenate appearance of the posterior nasal mucosa especially of the middle turbinates and contralateral inferior turbinate with a left deviation of the nasal septum with nasal spur. Nasosinusal MRI shows a progressive increase in size of the tissue mass compared to the previously CT occupying the right nasal fossa on almost all of its height, measuring 4 × 2.8 × 3.5cm without extension within the cavum with probable invasion of the lower part of the nasolacrimal duct and mass effect on both the sinusonasal bone septum and the intersinusonasal septum. This finding shows ethmoidal sinus fluid retention. The appearance, even if it remains unspecific, is compatible with inverted papilloma. The patient underwent complete endoscopic removal of the tumor with ethmoidectomy and right maxillary antrostomy. The extemporaneous examination is in favor of a malignant tumor lesion. Histopathologic analysis shows a tumor proliferation made of polymorphic cells with major anisocytosis, most often located in lobules. There is sometimes a somewhat palisadic seat on the periphery of the tumor mass. The mitotic index is 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields. The immunohistochemical study of the tumor found that the cytokeratin KL1 and CK7 and the neuroendocrine marker Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 are positive. Proliferation index Ki67 is of the order of 80%. Otherwise there is an absence of expression of PS100, MelanA, HMB45, desmin, p40, CD45 and EBV.
The clear positivity of cytokeratins formally excludes the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma and leads to neuroendocrine carcinoma. Given the atypia, the mitotic index, and the Ki67 proliferation index, it is a high-grade large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Extension assessment, comprising a PET SCAN, was negative. Postoperative treatment consisted in adjuvant polychemotherapy, with six cycles (cisplatin and etoposide), Followed by loco regional external radiotherapy. After 6 month follow-up, the patient was in complete clinical and radiological remission.

First of all, the patient is not smoking and reported an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta surgically treated by prosthesis under plavix. The beginning of the symptomatology goes back to 2 months before with right nasal obstruction of progressive onset, associated with right epistaxis and bloody rhinorrhea with right chronic eye watering. Nasal Endoscopy examination revealed a pinnkish burgeoning mass bleeding on contact and filling the right nostril vestibule. The patient didn't presents neurological signs nor cervical lymph nods. Otherwise, ophthalmologic examination found normal visual acuity and ocular mobility on both sides. Sinonasal computed tomography (CT) found a right nasal process enhanced after injection of contrast product with relatively little washing at the late time. Otherwise, there is no extension involvement at the level of the cavum and the pterygo palate fossa. This finding found also a crenate appearance of the posterior nasal mucosa especially of the middle turbinates and contralateral inferior turbinate with a left deviation of the nasal septum with nasal spur. Nasosinusal MRI shows a progressive increase in size of the tissue mass compared to the previously CT occupying the right nasal fossa on almost all of its height, measuring 4 × 2.8 × 3.5cm without extension within the cavum with probable invasion of the lower part of the nasolacrimal duct and mass effect on both the sinusonasal bone septum and the intersinusonasal septum. This finding shows ethmoidal sinus fluid retention. The appearance, even if it remains unspecific, is compatible with inverted papilloma. The patient underwent complete endoscopic removal of the tumor with ethmoidectomy and right maxillary antrostomy. The extemporaneous examination is in favor of a malignant tumor lesion. Histopathologic analysis shows a tumor proliferation made of polymorphic cells with major anisocytosis, most often located in lobules. There is sometimes a somewhat palisadic seat on the periphery of the tumor mass. The mitotic index is 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields. The immunohistochemical study of the tumor found that the cytokeratin KL1 and CK7 and the neuroendocrine marker Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 are positive. Proliferation index Ki67 is of the order of 80%. Otherwise there is an absence of expression of PS100, MelanA, HMB45, desmin, p40, CD45 and EBV.
The clear positivity of cytokeratins formally excludes the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma and leads to neuroendocrine carcinoma. Given the atypia, the mitotic index, and the Ki67 proliferation index, it is a high-grade large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Extension assessment, comprising a PET SCAN, was negative. Postoperative treatment consisted in adjuvant polychemotherapy, with six cycles (cisplatin and etoposide), Followed by loco regional external radiotherapy.

The obstetrical examination objectified an involuted uterus, an absence of vaginal and perineal cervical lesions, a fluid and red blood originating of endouterine. Furthermore, there was purpura. We therefore concluded a significant postpartum hemorrhage complicated by coagulopathy. Resuscitation measures were taken and an transfusion 1120 ml whole blood, red cell pellets 350 ml and 860 ml fresh frozen plasma have helped to management coagulopathy and anemia. Blood count at admission highlighted severe thrombocytopenia 23 0000 platelets and hemoglobin levels of 3.9 g/dl. The post natal care was also administered.
After seven days of hospitalization, she was going after an amendment to the clinical symptoms and normal laboratory tests. Twenty five days later, she returned to obstetric emergencies for significant bleeding with severe anemia with hemoglobin 9 g/dL without signs of hypovolemic shock. The gynecological examination was normal. The balance sheet of the coagulation was normal including prothrombin to 92% and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time. The treatments were based on oxytocin, tranexamic acid, etamsylate and strict regular monitoring. Transvaginal ultrasound coupled Doppler was normal. In the absence of arterial embolization, she was going with ambulatory monitoring. Two weeks later she presented again rebleeding requiring hospitalization resulting in a total hysterectomy after conditioning of the patient. Histological examination of the surgical specimen objectified in the cervix and uterine body the presence of arterial vessels proliferation homes large and small caliber associated with tissue hemorrhage.

He was taken to the operating room for drain removal, a right hemicolectomy, debridement of a duodenal injury, a Roux-en-y duodenojejunostomy, and an end ileostomy.

He had an inflamed throat, bradycardia at cardiac auscultation and there were no signs of heart failure. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed grade III atrioventricular (AV) bloc with a ventricular rate of 38 beats per minute.

Serum electrolytes, kidney and liver functions were within normal limits. A chest X-ray showed an appropriate cardiac size. The initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a normal global left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60%) and wall motion abnormalities (anteroseptal hypokinesia), with reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS= -14.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed increased signal intensity at the mid-lateral wall on T2-weighted images. Late enhancement revealed a patchy subepicardial hyperenhancement of the medio-distal segments of the anterior and anterolateral walls which confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis.

The TTE revealed a normal LVEF and an improvement in the LVGLS with segmental reduced values concordant with the CMR abnormalities.

He had an inflamed throat, bradycardia at cardiac auscultation and there were no signs of heart failure. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed grade III atrioventricular (AV) bloc with a ventricular rate of 38 beats per minute. Laboratory studies were remarkable for a HS-troponin level 181ng/L, a white blood cell count of 14270/mm³ with 48% lymphocytes, and elevated C-reactive protein at 90mg/L. Serum electrolytes, kidney and liver functions were within normal limits. A chest X-ray showed an appropriate cardiac size. The initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a normal global left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60%) and wall motion abnormalities (anteroseptal hypokinesia), with reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS= -14.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed increased signal intensity at the mid-lateral wall on T2-weighted images. Late enhancement revealed a patchy subepicardial hyperenhancement of the medio-distal segments of the anterior and anterolateral walls which confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis.

His past medical history was unremarkable. He no family history of heart disease or sudden death. Two-days prior the syncope, he developed chest pain and an influenza-like illness consisting of fevers, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. At the physical exam, the patient was febrile at 39°C. He had an inflamed throat, bradycardia at cardiac auscultation and there were no signs of heart failure. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed grade III atrioventricular (AV) bloc with a ventricular rate of 38 beats per minute. Laboratory studies were remarkable for a HS-troponin level 181ng/L, a white blood cell count of 14270/mm³ with 48% lymphocytes, and elevated C-reactive protein at 90mg/L. Serum electrolytes, kidney and liver functions were within normal limits. A chest X-ray showed an appropriate cardiac size. The initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a normal global left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60%) and wall motion abnormalities (anteroseptal hypokinesia), with reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS= -14.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed increased signal intensity at the mid-lateral wall on T2-weighted images. Late enhancement revealed a patchy subepicardial hyperenhancement of the medio-distal segments of the anterior and anterolateral walls which confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and doxycycline. All serological tests (chlamydia, coxiella, mycoplasma, rickettsia, lyme and bartonella) obtained during the hospitalization were negative. Five days later, the patient was asymptomatic. The 24 hours ECG monitoring showed a sinus rhythm. The TTE revealed a normal LVEF and an improvement in the LVGLS with segmental reduced values concordant with the CMR abnormalities.

Laboratory studies were remarkable for a HS-troponin level 181ng/L, a white blood cell count of 14270/mm³ with 48% lymphocytes, and elevated C-reactive protein at 90mg/L. Serum electrolytes, kidney and liver functions were within normal limits. A chest X-ray showed an appropriate cardiac size. The initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a normal global left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60%) and wall motion abnormalities (anteroseptal hypokinesia), with reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS= -14.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed increased signal intensity at the mid-lateral wall on T2-weighted images. Late enhancement revealed a patchy subepicardial hyperenhancement of the medio-distal segments of the anterior and anterolateral walls which confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and doxycycline. All serological tests (chlamydia, coxiella, mycoplasma, rickettsia, lyme and bartonella) obtained during the hospitalization were negative. Five days later, the patient was asymptomatic. The 24 hours ECG monitoring showed a sinus rhythm. The TTE revealed a normal LVEF and an improvement in the LVGLS with segmental reduced values concordant with the CMR abnormalities. At one-month follow-up the patient made a full recovery without any recurring cardiovascular symptoms or abnormal electrocardiographic or echocardiographic findings.

The patient was having severe right sided abdominal pain with sudden onset. She was in the 18 th week of her pregnancy based on last menstrual period. Obstetric ultrasound measurements revealed a live pregnancy compatible with 18 weeks gestation without any abnormality. However, a 15x12cm in size edematous multicystic adnexal mass occupying the mid and upper right abdomen without vascularity was identified. The mass was suspected to originate from right ovary. It was pushing the pregnant uterus into the left and anterior direction. There was no ultrasonographic evidence of malignancy. Considering the severe sudden pain complaint and adnexal mass finding, explorative laparotomy was planned for the suspected diagnosis of adnexal torsion. A mediolateral (near vertical) skin incision was made originated from infra-umbilical level on the lateral side of right rectus muscle. Specifically, the starting point for this slightly oblique incision was at 3cm lateral to the midline and near to lateral one third of the rectus muscle. The skin and fascia incisions were approximately 4cm and 2.5cm in length, respectively and this difference was due to the thick subcutaneous fat tissue. The oblique paramedian incision of the anterior rectus sheath was approximately 2cm medial to the lateral border of the rectus muscle and it was extended to caudal-lateral direction, down to 1/2cm to the lateral border of rectus muscle. The lateral edge of anterior rectus sheath incision was dissected off from the rectus muscle laterally up to semilunar line of rectus muscle in 1cm width. Then, the rectus muscle was retracted medially to expose the posterior sheath of rectus (below the arcuate line, only the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum are exposed). An oblique incision was made on the posterior sheath of rectus and peritoneum behind the rectus muscle, in a projection of the anterior sheath incision. In this manner, the abdominal wall incisions were located at anterior and posterior sheaths of rectus muscle at least 1/2cm medial to the semilunar line and to the lateral border of rectus. In other words, incision was not made from fascial layers' merging point or by muscle splitting dissection. Therefore, traction forces from enlarging uterus in advancing pregnant abdomen could be minimized. A large edematous, necrotic and dark purple torsion of a right adnexal mass was observed. It was pulled out and was partially dissected from its surface layer following a 2cm incision. The cystic structure was aspirated and right salpingo-ooferectomy was performed. The operation was completed by avoiding the manipulation of the pregnant uterus. Frozen section pathology of the removed specimen was reported as benign (necrotic tissues, teratoma) and final pathology was mucinous cystadenoma. Follow up on the pregnant patient was uneventful a month later.

The patient was having severe right sided abdominal pain with sudden onset. She was in the 18 th week of her pregnancy based on last menstrual period. Obstetric ultrasound measurements revealed a live pregnancy compatible with 18 weeks gestation without any abnormality. However, a 15x12cm in size edematous multicystic adnexal mass occupying the mid and upper right abdomen without vascularity was identified. The mass was suspected to originate from right ovary. It was pushing the pregnant uterus into the left and anterior direction. There was no ultrasonographic evidence of malignancy. Considering the severe sudden pain complaint and adnexal mass finding, explorative laparotomy was planned for the suspected diagnosis of adnexal torsion. A mediolateral (near vertical) skin incision was made originated from infra-umbilical level on the lateral side of right rectus muscle. Specifically, the starting point for this slightly oblique incision was at 3cm lateral to the midline and near to lateral one third of the rectus muscle. The skin and fascia incisions were approximately 4cm and 2.5cm in length, respectively and this difference was due to the thick subcutaneous fat tissue. The oblique paramedian incision of the anterior rectus sheath was approximately 2cm medial to the lateral border of the rectus muscle and it was extended to caudal-lateral direction, down to 1/2cm to the lateral border of rectus muscle. The lateral edge of anterior rectus sheath incision was dissected off from the rectus muscle laterally up to semilunar line of rectus muscle in 1cm width. Then, the rectus muscle was retracted medially to expose the posterior sheath of rectus (below the arcuate line, only the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum are exposed). An oblique incision was made on the posterior sheath of rectus and peritoneum behind the rectus muscle, in a projection of the anterior sheath incision. In this manner, the abdominal wall incisions were located at anterior and posterior sheaths of rectus muscle at least 1/2cm medial to the semilunar line and to the lateral border of rectus. In other words, incision was not made from fascial layers' merging point or by muscle splitting dissection. Therefore, traction forces from enlarging uterus in advancing pregnant abdomen could be minimized. A large edematous, necrotic and dark purple torsion of a right adnexal mass was observed. It was pulled out and was partially dissected from its surface layer following a 2cm incision. The cystic structure was aspirated and right salpingo-ooferectomy was performed. The operation was completed by avoiding the manipulation of the pregnant uterus.

The patient was having severe right sided abdominal pain with sudden onset. She was in the 18 th week of her pregnancy based on last menstrual period. Obstetric ultrasound measurements revealed a live pregnancy compatible with 18 weeks gestation without any abnormality. However, a 15x12cm in size edematous multicystic adnexal mass occupying the mid and upper right abdomen without vascularity was identified. The mass was suspected to originate from right ovary. It was pushing the pregnant uterus into the left and anterior direction. There was no ultrasonographic evidence of malignancy. Considering the severe sudden pain complaint and adnexal mass finding, explorative laparotomy was planned for the suspected diagnosis of adnexal torsion. A mediolateral (near vertical) skin incision was made originated from infra-umbilical level on the lateral side of right rectus muscle. Specifically, the starting point for this slightly oblique incision was at 3cm lateral to the midline and near to lateral one third of the rectus muscle. The skin and fascia incisions were approximately 4cm and 2.5cm in length, respectively and this difference was due to the thick subcutaneous fat tissue. The oblique paramedian incision of the anterior rectus sheath was approximately 2cm medial to the lateral border of the rectus muscle and it was extended to caudal-lateral direction, down to 1/2cm to the lateral border of rectus muscle. The lateral edge of anterior rectus sheath incision was dissected off from the rectus muscle laterally up to semilunar line of rectus muscle in 1cm width. Then, the rectus muscle was retracted medially to expose the posterior sheath of rectus (below the arcuate line, only the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum are exposed). An oblique incision was made on the posterior sheath of rectus and peritoneum behind the rectus muscle, in a projection of the anterior sheath incision. In this manner, the abdominal wall incisions were located at anterior and posterior sheaths of rectus muscle at least 1/2cm medial to the semilunar line and to the lateral border of rectus. In other words, incision was not made from fascial layers' merging point or by muscle splitting dissection. Therefore, traction forces from enlarging uterus in advancing pregnant abdomen could be minimized. A large edematous, necrotic and dark purple torsion of a right adnexal mass was observed. It was pulled out and was partially dissected from its surface layer following a 2cm incision. The cystic structure was aspirated and right salpingo-ooferectomy was performed. The operation was completed by avoiding the manipulation of the pregnant uterus. Frozen section pathology of the removed specimen was reported as benign (necrotic tissues, teratoma) and final pathology was mucinous cystadenoma. Follow up on the pregnant patient was uneventful a month later.

A mediolateral (near vertical) skin incision was made originated from infra-umbilical level on the lateral side of right rectus muscle. Specifically, the starting point for this slightly oblique incision was at 3cm lateral to the midline and near to lateral one third of the rectus muscle. The skin and fascia incisions were approximately 4cm and 2.5cm in length, respectively and this difference was due to the thick subcutaneous fat tissue. The oblique paramedian incision of the anterior rectus sheath was approximately 2cm medial to the lateral border of the rectus muscle and it was extended to caudal-lateral direction, down to 1/2cm to the lateral border of rectus muscle. The lateral edge of anterior rectus sheath incision was dissected off from the rectus muscle laterally up to semilunar line of rectus muscle in 1cm width. Then, the rectus muscle was retracted medially to expose the posterior sheath of rectus (below the arcuate line, only the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum are exposed). An oblique incision was made on the posterior sheath of rectus and peritoneum behind the rectus muscle, in a projection of the anterior sheath incision. In this manner, the abdominal wall incisions were located at anterior and posterior sheaths of rectus muscle at least 1/2cm medial to the semilunar line and to the lateral border of rectus. In other words, incision was not made from fascial layers' merging point or by muscle splitting dissection. Therefore, traction forces from enlarging uterus in advancing pregnant abdomen could be minimized. A large edematous, necrotic and dark purple torsion of a right adnexal mass was observed. It was pulled out and was partially dissected from its surface layer following a 2cm incision. The cystic structure was aspirated and right salpingo-ooferectomy was performed. The operation was completed by avoiding the manipulation of the pregnant uterus. Frozen section pathology of the removed specimen was reported as benign (necrotic tissues, teratoma) and final pathology was mucinous cystadenoma. Follow up on the pregnant patient was uneventful a month later.

Moreover the ipsilateral scrotum was empty and the testis could be palpated with difficulty lying in a high inguinal position. Ultrasonography showed a loop of herniated small bowel and an undescended testis on the right. At operation, under general anesthesia, an extended transverse inguinal incision was made. Upon entering the inguinal canal a large hernia sac was identified. This followed a course through the superficial inguinal ring, extended upwards to the anterior abdomninal wall below the subcutaneous plane and was fixed in the area of the right iliac crest. We noticed that the hernia orifice was in a higher than normal position 5 cm from the pubic bone. This bulk was easily reduced back to the abdomen along with an ipsilateral mobile intravaginal testis. After careful isolation of the sac at a length of 3 cm the ipsilateral testis was isolated. The vas and the vessels were intravaginal, the gubernaculum was fixed in an ectopic position and the dorsal inguinal wall was lax. We removed the large sac after separating the vas and vessels and the testis. Moreover we strengthened the dorsal inguinal wall, fixated the testis in a subdartos pouch and closed the wound. Patient stayed for a day in the hospital. No postoperative complications happened. Three years later the boy was operated for left hydrocele. The boy remains in perfect health now five years after the initial operation.

Biopsy of the ulcerative lesion was performed and the microscopic features showed an inflammatory infiltrate rich in plasma cells. Based on this microscopical finding, the final diagnosis was periodontal disease associated with a proliferative non-neoplastic lesion. The patient was referred to a specialized dental surgeon and underwent periodontal therapy including surgical procedures. After that, according to follow-up with the patient, there were no signs of disease remission. The lesion increased in size, although the patient did not complain of any symptoms. A second biopsy was performed and the microscopic features again showed a rich inflammatory infiltrate with mononuclear cells and histiocytic cells, characterized by pale histiocytes with lobed nuclei, resembling a bean. A varying number of eosinophils also were observed, without any evidence of atypical cells present in this infiltrate. An immunohistochemical staining panel was done to determine the nature of this inflammatory infiltrate by using antibodies S-100, CD1a, CD-68 and CD45RO that were positive.

Active and passive exercises were started at an early period after surgery. Recurrence was not detected at his last control visit. Knee movements were at full range when compared with the other knee. There was no pain or other complaints.

On physical examination, we found fever at 38°C, polypnea at 32 cycles/min, arterial hypertension at 160/90 mmHg, malar rash, synovitis of wrists, elbows and ankles, and edema on both legs. Diagnostic assessment: laboratory tests disclosed the following values: Increase level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate 120 mm/1 st hour, C reactive protein was 20 mg/l. The blood count showed hemoglobin at 9g/dl, MCV at 85 µ 3, lymphopenia at 400/mm 3, while platelets were normal 450 000/mm 3. Direct coombs test was negative. Serum Albumin was 25g/l; proteins level was low at 50g/l and proteinuria at 3.2g/day. Creatinine was normal. Anti-nuclear antibody ANA were positive 1/320 with homogeneous pattern, anti-dsDNA level was 160U/ml. Anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies were positive 25UGPL. Rheumatoid Factor was negative. C3 and C4 complement fractions were low (0.2 g/l and 0.05 g/l). Chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed proximal pulmonary embolism. Renal ultrasound was normal. Renal biopsy reveals immunocomplex nephritis, lupus nephritis, segmental mesangial proliferation, mild activity lupus nephritis class III (A/C). Before starting corticosteroids, we analyzed electrolytes. Serum calcium was elevated 132 mg/l with hyper-calciuria 479 mg/24 h. 25 OHD was normal. Alcaline phosphatase was 420 UI/l. the patient did not have any symptoms of hypercalcemia. Serum protein Electrophoresis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Serum and urine immunofixation as well as Bence-Jones proteinuria were negative. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was high 628 pg/ml. CT scan and ultrasound of parathyroid imaging revealed a lower left parathyroid nodule measuring 2cm x 1 cm. Femoral and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) showed osteoporosis (T-score: -2.6). In addition, we found multiple pelvic osteolytic lesions at CT scan. Other causes of hypercalcemia and bone lysis were excluded. The diagnosis in this case was SLE with lupus nephritis class III and anti-phospholipid syndrome, complicated by pulmonary embolism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism causing severe hypercalcemia, osteoporosis. Therapeutic intervention: the patient was given a pulse of methyl-prednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, associated with intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 /month for 6 months. Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day was prescribed as a maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg/day. Treatment of pulmonary embolism was initiated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 0.1 ml/10 kg/12h) followed by antivitamin K. For Hypercalcemia, patient has received intravenous fluid with furosemide. She also required Alendronate 70 mg/week with Vitamin D 400u/day for osteoporosis. The left parathyroid gland was surgically removed. Histopathological examination revealed parathyroid adenoma. Her immediate postoperative parathyroid hormone level was 64 pg/ml with a calcium level of 98 mg/l. Follow-up and outcomes: forty-eight hours after the surgery she developed oral paresthesia. She had hypocalcemia at 72 mg/l. She required oral supplementation for few months. Additional investigations for multiple endocrine neoplasia were negative. The patient remained asymptomatic. Her SLE was calm without any relapse. Control of proteinuria was negative. Corticosteroids was dropped. The follow-up was 4 years.

On physical examination, we found fever at 38°C, polypnea at 32 cycles/min, arterial hypertension at 160/90 mmHg, malar rash, synovitis of wrists, elbows and ankles, and edema on both legs. Diagnostic assessment: laboratory tests disclosed the following values: Increase level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate 120 mm/1 st hour, C reactive protein was 20 mg/l. The blood count showed hemoglobin at 9g/dl, MCV at 85 µ 3, lymphopenia at 400/mm 3, while platelets were normal 450 000/mm 3. Direct coombs test was negative. Serum Albumin was 25g/l; proteins level was low at 50g/l and proteinuria at 3.2g/day. Creatinine was normal. Anti-nuclear antibody ANA were positive 1/320 with homogeneous pattern, anti-dsDNA level was 160U/ml. Anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies were positive 25UGPL. Rheumatoid Factor was negative. C3 and C4 complement fractions were low (0.2 g/l and 0.05 g/l). Chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed proximal pulmonary embolism. Renal ultrasound was normal. Renal biopsy reveals immunocomplex nephritis, lupus nephritis, segmental mesangial proliferation, mild activity lupus nephritis class III (A/C). Before starting corticosteroids, we analyzed electrolytes. Serum calcium was elevated 132 mg/l with hyper-calciuria 479 mg/24 h. 25 OHD was normal. Alcaline phosphatase was 420 UI/l. the patient did not have any symptoms of hypercalcemia. Serum protein Electrophoresis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Serum and urine immunofixation as well as Bence-Jones proteinuria were negative. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was high 628 pg/ml. CT scan and ultrasound of parathyroid imaging revealed a lower left parathyroid nodule measuring 2cm x 1 cm. Femoral and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) showed osteoporosis (T-score: -2.6). In addition, we found multiple pelvic osteolytic lesions at CT scan. Other causes of hypercalcemia and bone lysis were excluded. The diagnosis in this case was SLE with lupus nephritis class III and anti-phospholipid syndrome, complicated by pulmonary embolism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism causing severe hypercalcemia, osteoporosis. Therapeutic intervention: the patient was given a pulse of methyl-prednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, associated with intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 /month for 6 months. Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day was prescribed as a maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg/day. Treatment of pulmonary embolism was initiated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 0.1 ml/10 kg/12h) followed by antivitamin K. For Hypercalcemia, patient has received intravenous fluid with furosemide. She also required Alendronate 70 mg/week with Vitamin D 400u/day for osteoporosis. The left parathyroid gland was surgically removed. Histopathological examination revealed parathyroid adenoma. Her immediate postoperative parathyroid hormone level was 64 pg/ml with a calcium level of 98 mg/l. Follow-up and outcomes: forty-eight hours after the surgery she developed oral paresthesia. She had hypocalcemia at 72 mg/l. She required oral supplementation for few months. Additional investigations for multiple endocrine neoplasia were negative. The patient remained asymptomatic. Her SLE was calm without any relapse. Control of proteinuria was negative. Corticosteroids was dropped. The follow-up was 4 years.

On physical examination, we found fever at 38°C, polypnea at 32 cycles/min, arterial hypertension at 160/90 mmHg, malar rash, synovitis of wrists, elbows and ankles, and edema on both legs. Diagnostic assessment: laboratory tests disclosed the following values: Increase level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate 120 mm/1 st hour, C reactive protein was 20 mg/l. The blood count showed hemoglobin at 9g/dl, MCV at 85 µ 3, lymphopenia at 400/mm 3, while platelets were normal 450 000/mm 3. Direct coombs test was negative. Serum Albumin was 25g/l; proteins level was low at 50g/l and proteinuria at 3.2g/day. Creatinine was normal. Anti-nuclear antibody ANA were positive 1/320 with homogeneous pattern, anti-dsDNA level was 160U/ml. Anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies were positive 25UGPL. Rheumatoid Factor was negative. C3 and C4 complement fractions were low (0.2 g/l and 0.05 g/l). Chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed proximal pulmonary embolism. Renal ultrasound was normal. Renal biopsy reveals immunocomplex nephritis, lupus nephritis, segmental mesangial proliferation, mild activity lupus nephritis class III (A/C). Before starting corticosteroids, we analyzed electrolytes. Serum calcium was elevated 132 mg/l with hyper-calciuria 479 mg/24 h. 25 OHD was normal. Alcaline phosphatase was 420 UI/l. the patient did not have any symptoms of hypercalcemia. Serum protein Electrophoresis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Serum and urine immunofixation as well as Bence-Jones proteinuria were negative. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was high 628 pg/ml. CT scan and ultrasound of parathyroid imaging revealed a lower left parathyroid nodule measuring 2cm x 1 cm. Femoral and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) showed osteoporosis (T-score: -2.6). In addition, we found multiple pelvic osteolytic lesions at CT scan. Other causes of hypercalcemia and bone lysis were excluded. The diagnosis in this case was SLE with lupus nephritis class III and anti-phospholipid syndrome, complicated by pulmonary embolism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism causing severe hypercalcemia, osteoporosis. Therapeutic intervention: the patient was given a pulse of methyl-prednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, associated with intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 /month for 6 months. Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day was prescribed as a maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg/day. Treatment of pulmonary embolism was initiated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 0.1 ml/10 kg/12h) followed by antivitamin K. For Hypercalcemia, patient has received intravenous fluid with furosemide. She also required Alendronate 70 mg/week with Vitamin D 400u/day for osteoporosis. The left parathyroid gland was surgically removed. Histopathological examination revealed parathyroid adenoma. Her immediate postoperative parathyroid hormone level was 64 pg/ml with a calcium level of 98 mg/l. Follow-up and outcomes: forty-eight hours after the surgery she developed oral paresthesia. She had hypocalcemia at 72 mg/l. She required oral supplementation for few months. Additional investigations for multiple endocrine neoplasia were negative. The patient remained asymptomatic. Her SLE was calm without any relapse. Control of proteinuria was negative. Corticosteroids was dropped. The follow-up was 4 years.

She consulted at our emergency service for the exacerbation of a left pelvic pain that has been evolving for two weeks prior to admission. A transient lull was observed following a treatment with a progesteron (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and an antispasmodic (tiemonium methylsulfate) in a community clinic. The resurgence of that lancinating and permanent pain irradiating to the loins and associated with slight vaginal bleeding prompted consultation. She had first menses at 14 and her menstrual cycle is regular with a length of 30 days. She has never practiced contraception. She has been adequately treated for acute pelvic inflammatory disease five years earlier. Her only child is a girl born vaginally seven years ago. Her blood group is B rhesus positive and she has never undergone surgery. She presented with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and the urinary pregnancy test was positive but echography was not yet done. On admission, besides the main complain, the patient had vaginal bleeding and nausea but neither fever, nor vomiting. On physical examination her general condition was good and the blood pressure was 110/70 millimeters of mercury, the respiratory rate: 20 cycles / minute; the pulse rate: 70 pulsations/minute and the temperature: 37.3 degree Celsius. The conjunctivae were pink and the tongue was clean and moist. There were no cervical adenopathies. The breast and cardiopulmonary examination revealed no abnormalities. The abdomen was flat, and mobile with respiration. On palpation there was just a tenderness of the left iliac fossa and the bowel sounds were normal on auscultation. Inspection under speculum revealed normal gravid external cervical os and there was no vaginal discharge. On digital exploration, the cervix was posterior long and closed, the uterus was globular, increased in size and compatible with an eight weeks pregnancy. The left adnexae presented with a tender, smooth and mobile mass of seven centimeters diameter but the right one were normal. The posterior cervico-vaginal fornix was neither tender nor bulging. We suspected a non ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy with the following differentials: heterotopic pregnancy, torsion of ovarian cyst in pregnancy, and intra-cystic ovarian bleeding in pregnancy. Paraclinical investigations revealed: beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β hCG) level of 96 702 milli International Units per milliliter of plasma (mIU/ml). Ultrasonography revealed a heterogenous left ovarian mass of 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus and no peritoneal effusion. This comforted our first diagnosis. After a normal pre-operative work up, an emergency laparotomy was done under general anesthesia. The findings were: left ovary containing a gestational sac and the corpus luteum, normal right adnexae, normal left tube and normal uterus. There was no hemoperitoneum. We dissected the ovarian capsule and carried out ablation of the gestational sac, then we did hemostasis. The specimen was analysed by the pathologist who found decidual cells and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule and thus confirmed the ovarian pregnancy. Post operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged six days after surgery. The ?hCG level decreased and disappeared 25 days after surgery.

A transient lull was observed following a treatment with a progesteron (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and an antispasmodic (tiemonium methylsulfate) in a community clinic. The resurgence of that lancinating and permanent pain irradiating to the loins and associated with slight vaginal bleeding prompted consultation. She had first menses at 14 and her menstrual cycle is regular with a length of 30 days. She has never practiced contraception. She has been adequately treated for acute pelvic inflammatory disease five years earlier. Her only child is a girl born vaginally seven years ago. Her blood group is B rhesus positive and she has never undergone surgery. She presented with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and the urinary pregnancy test was positive but echography was not yet done. On admission, besides the main complain, the patient had vaginal bleeding and nausea but neither fever, nor vomiting. On physical examination her general condition was good and the blood pressure was 110/70 millimeters of mercury, the respiratory rate: 20 cycles / minute; the pulse rate: 70 pulsations/minute and the temperature: 37.3 degree Celsius. The conjunctivae were pink and the tongue was clean and moist. There were no cervical adenopathies. The breast and cardiopulmonary examination revealed no abnormalities. The abdomen was flat, and mobile with respiration. On palpation there was just a tenderness of the left iliac fossa and the bowel sounds were normal on auscultation. Inspection under speculum revealed normal gravid external cervical os and there was no vaginal discharge. On digital exploration, the cervix was posterior long and closed, the uterus was globular, increased in size and compatible with an eight weeks pregnancy. The left adnexae presented with a tender, smooth and mobile mass of seven centimeters diameter but the right one were normal. The posterior cervico-vaginal fornix was neither tender nor bulging. We suspected a non ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy with the following differentials: heterotopic pregnancy, torsion of ovarian cyst in pregnancy, and intra-cystic ovarian bleeding in pregnancy. Paraclinical investigations revealed: beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β hCG) level of 96 702 milli International Units per milliliter of plasma (mIU/ml). Ultrasonography revealed a heterogenous left ovarian mass of 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus and no peritoneal effusion. This comforted our first diagnosis. After a normal pre-operative work up, an emergency laparotomy was done under general anesthesia. The findings were: left ovary containing a gestational sac and the corpus luteum, normal right adnexae, normal left tube and normal uterus. There was no hemoperitoneum. We dissected the ovarian capsule and carried out ablation of the gestational sac, then we did hemostasis. The specimen was analysed by the pathologist who found decidual cells and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule and thus confirmed the ovarian pregnancy. Post operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged six days after surgery. The ?hCG level decreased and disappeared 25 days after surgery.

The resurgence of that lancinating and permanent pain irradiating to the loins and associated with slight vaginal bleeding prompted consultation. She had first menses at 14 and her menstrual cycle is regular with a length of 30 days. She has never practiced contraception. She has been adequately treated for acute pelvic inflammatory disease five years earlier. Her only child is a girl born vaginally seven years ago. Her blood group is B rhesus positive and she has never undergone surgery. She presented with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and the urinary pregnancy test was positive but echography was not yet done. On admission, besides the main complain, the patient had vaginal bleeding and nausea but neither fever, nor vomiting. On physical examination her general condition was good and the blood pressure was 110/70 millimeters of mercury, the respiratory rate: 20 cycles / minute; the pulse rate: 70 pulsations/minute and the temperature: 37.3 degree Celsius. The conjunctivae were pink and the tongue was clean and moist. There were no cervical adenopathies. The breast and cardiopulmonary examination revealed no abnormalities. The abdomen was flat, and mobile with respiration. On palpation there was just a tenderness of the left iliac fossa and the bowel sounds were normal on auscultation. Inspection under speculum revealed normal gravid external cervical os and there was no vaginal discharge. On digital exploration, the cervix was posterior long and closed, the uterus was globular, increased in size and compatible with an eight weeks pregnancy. The left adnexae presented with a tender, smooth and mobile mass of seven centimeters diameter but the right one were normal. The posterior cervico-vaginal fornix was neither tender nor bulging. We suspected a non ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy with the following differentials: heterotopic pregnancy, torsion of ovarian cyst in pregnancy, and intra-cystic ovarian bleeding in pregnancy. Paraclinical investigations revealed: beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β hCG) level of 96 702 milli International Units per milliliter of plasma (mIU/ml). Ultrasonography revealed a heterogenous left ovarian mass of 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus and no peritoneal effusion. This comforted our first diagnosis. After a normal pre-operative work up, an emergency laparotomy was done under general anesthesia. The findings were: left ovary containing a gestational sac and the corpus luteum, normal right adnexae, normal left tube and normal uterus. There was no hemoperitoneum. We dissected the ovarian capsule and carried out ablation of the gestational sac, then we did hemostasis. The specimen was analysed by the pathologist who found decidual cells and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule and thus confirmed the ovarian pregnancy.

She consulted at our emergency service for the exacerbation of a left pelvic pain that has been evolving for two weeks prior to admission. A transient lull was observed following a treatment with a progesteron (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and an antispasmodic (tiemonium methylsulfate) in a community clinic. The resurgence of that lancinating and permanent pain irradiating to the loins and associated with slight vaginal bleeding prompted consultation. She had first menses at 14 and her menstrual cycle is regular with a length of 30 days. She has never practiced contraception. She has been adequately treated for acute pelvic inflammatory disease five years earlier. Her only child is a girl born vaginally seven years ago. Her blood group is B rhesus positive and she has never undergone surgery. She presented with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and the urinary pregnancy test was positive but echography was not yet done. On admission, besides the main complain, the patient had vaginal bleeding and nausea but neither fever, nor vomiting. On physical examination her general condition was good and the blood pressure was 110/70 millimeters of mercury, the respiratory rate: 20 cycles / minute; the pulse rate: 70 pulsations/minute and the temperature: 37.3 degree Celsius. The conjunctivae were pink and the tongue was clean and moist. There were no cervical adenopathies. The breast and cardiopulmonary examination revealed no abnormalities. The abdomen was flat, and mobile with respiration. On palpation there was just a tenderness of the left iliac fossa and the bowel sounds were normal on auscultation. Inspection under speculum revealed normal gravid external cervical os and there was no vaginal discharge. On digital exploration, the cervix was posterior long and closed, the uterus was globular, increased in size and compatible with an eight weeks pregnancy. The left adnexae presented with a tender, smooth and mobile mass of seven centimeters diameter but the right one were normal. The posterior cervico-vaginal fornix was neither tender nor bulging. We suspected a non ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy with the following differentials: heterotopic pregnancy, torsion of ovarian cyst in pregnancy, and intra-cystic ovarian bleeding in pregnancy. Paraclinical investigations revealed: beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β hCG) level of 96 702 milli International Units per milliliter of plasma (mIU/ml). Ultrasonography revealed a heterogenous left ovarian mass of 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus and no peritoneal effusion. This comforted our first diagnosis. After a normal pre-operative work up, an emergency laparotomy was done under general anesthesia. The findings were: left ovary containing a gestational sac and the corpus luteum, normal right adnexae, normal left tube and normal uterus. There was no hemoperitoneum. We dissected the ovarian capsule and carried out ablation of the gestational sac, then we did hemostasis. The specimen was analysed by the pathologist who found decidual cells and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule and thus confirmed the ovarian pregnancy.

The findings were: left ovary containing a gestational sac and the corpus luteum, normal right adnexae, normal left tube and normal uterus. There was no hemoperitoneum. We dissected the ovarian capsule and carried out ablation of the gestational sac, then we did hemostasis. The specimen was analysed by the pathologist who found decidual cells and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule and thus confirmed the ovarian pregnancy. Post operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged six days after surgery. The ?hCG level decreased and disappeared 25 days after surgery.

Chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any other localization. The patient was operated by performing a right extra-dural frontal approach, a cyst puncture was done in the first intention because the cyst was adherent to the neighbouring structures making its complete removal impossible, then a microscopic extirpation of the cystic membrane, combined with abundant washing by hypertonic serum to sterilize the cystic sit and reduce chances of dissemination. Histological examination was in favour of intra-orbital hydatidosis. Postoperatively, the patient was given an antihelminthic treatment of albendazole at a dose of 10mg per kilogram per day in 3 doses separated by 2 weeks; the evolution was marked by the significant regression of the exophthalmia and the gradual improvement of the visual acuity.

The child was diagnosed with a ‘‘severe communication disorder,'' with social interaction difficulties and sensory processing delay. A composite follow-up of all previous assessments and investigations was undertaken. Blood work was normal (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and ferritin). Genetic testing was unremarkable (normal karyotype, negative for fragile X) and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in search of a demyelinating attack of the white matter, electroencephalography (EEG), optometry assessment were also normal. At the conclusion of this composite assessment, the boy was given a primary diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. A plan was instituted including speech-language therapy, intensive individualized educational programming, and contact was encouraged with the Autism Society. For that purpose, the parents moved to morocco to be surrounded by family without any huge improvement. Upon direct questioning at initial presentation, the 3-year-old child was reported by the parents to have unexplained fatigue, Gastrointestinal symptoms included bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Psychiatric symptoms included a frequently depressed mood, disproportionate anger, and emotional lability. On exploring his history, the child was born from yemenite father and Moroccan mother in Germany at-term weighing 3500 g with an Apgar score of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. No concerns were present in the neonatal period. Development in the first 24 months of life appeared fine according to the parents-his motor skills seemed to progress normally and he achieved expected milestones. After 2 years of age, however, his language skills slowly began to regress. He also demonstrated a change in temperament as he started to whine repeatedly and to scream without provocation. Physical examination revealed a height and weight normal for age. He was uncommunicative, restless, and somewhat agitated. General examination was unremarkable other than dark rings around the eyes. There were no dysmorphic features evident. He had difficulty maintaining eye contact, and he appeared disinterested in what was taking place. No abnormality was found on abdominal assessment. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were 76 U (normal < 10). The patient underwent upper endoscopy as duodenal biopsy to confirm a celiac disease diagnosis. It shows a total villous atrophy corresponding to a stage 4 of Marsh classification. Given the positive screen for celiac disease (positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and results of duodenal biopsy), dietary intervention was immediately commenced. All gluten was eliminated from the boy's diet. Within 1 month, the boy's gastrointestinal symptoms were relieved and his behavior had changed. The mother reported that her boy became progressively more communicative. The child has continued on the gluten-free diet and has progressed well and remained healthy over the following 6 months.

Genetic testing was unremarkable (normal karyotype, negative for fragile X) and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in search of a demyelinating attack of the white matter, electroencephalography (EEG), optometry assessment were also normal. At the conclusion of this composite assessment, the boy was given a primary diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. A plan was instituted including speech-language therapy, intensive individualized educational programming, and contact was encouraged with the Autism Society. For that purpose, the parents moved to morocco to be surrounded by family without any huge improvement. Upon direct questioning at initial presentation, the 3-year-old child was reported by the parents to have unexplained fatigue, Gastrointestinal symptoms included bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Psychiatric symptoms included a frequently depressed mood, disproportionate anger, and emotional lability. On exploring his history, the child was born from yemenite father and Moroccan mother in Germany at-term weighing 3500 g with an Apgar score of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. No concerns were present in the neonatal period. Development in the first 24 months of life appeared fine according to the parents-his motor skills seemed to progress normally and he achieved expected milestones. After 2 years of age, however, his language skills slowly began to regress. He also demonstrated a change in temperament as he started to whine repeatedly and to scream without provocation. Physical examination revealed a height and weight normal for age. He was uncommunicative, restless, and somewhat agitated. General examination was unremarkable other than dark rings around the eyes. There were no dysmorphic features evident. He had difficulty maintaining eye contact, and he appeared disinterested in what was taking place. No abnormality was found on abdominal assessment. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were 76 U (normal < 10). The patient underwent upper endoscopy as duodenal biopsy to confirm a celiac disease diagnosis. It shows a total villous atrophy corresponding to a stage 4 of Marsh classification. Given the positive screen for celiac disease (positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and results of duodenal biopsy), dietary intervention was immediately commenced. All gluten was eliminated from the boy's diet. Within 1 month, the boy's gastrointestinal symptoms were relieved and his behavior had changed. The mother reported that her boy became progressively more communicative. The child has continued on the gluten-free diet and has progressed well and remained healthy over the following 6 months.

A plan was instituted including speech-language therapy, intensive individualized educational programming, and contact was encouraged with the Autism Society. For that purpose, the parents moved to morocco to be surrounded by family without any huge improvement. Upon direct questioning at initial presentation, the 3-year-old child was reported by the parents to have unexplained fatigue, Gastrointestinal symptoms included bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Psychiatric symptoms included a frequently depressed mood, disproportionate anger, and emotional lability. On exploring his history, the child was born from yemenite father and Moroccan mother in Germany at-term weighing 3500 g with an Apgar score of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. No concerns were present in the neonatal period. Development in the first 24 months of life appeared fine according to the parents-his motor skills seemed to progress normally and he achieved expected milestones. After 2 years of age, however, his language skills slowly began to regress. He also demonstrated a change in temperament as he started to whine repeatedly and to scream without provocation. Physical examination revealed a height and weight normal for age. He was uncommunicative, restless, and somewhat agitated. General examination was unremarkable other than dark rings around the eyes. There were no dysmorphic features evident. He had difficulty maintaining eye contact, and he appeared disinterested in what was taking place. No abnormality was found on abdominal assessment. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were 76 U (normal < 10). The patient underwent upper endoscopy as duodenal biopsy to confirm a celiac disease diagnosis. It shows a total villous atrophy corresponding to a stage 4 of Marsh classification. Given the positive screen for celiac disease (positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and results of duodenal biopsy), dietary intervention was immediately commenced. All gluten was eliminated from the boy's diet. Within 1 month, the boy's gastrointestinal symptoms were relieved and his behavior had changed. The mother reported that her boy became progressively more communicative. The child has continued on the gluten-free diet and has progressed well and remained healthy over the following 6 months.

He has no family history of illness or autistic spectrum disorder. The history revealed that at 2 years of age. The child was diagnosed with a ‘‘severe communication disorder,'' with social interaction difficulties and sensory processing delay. A composite follow-up of all previous assessments and investigations was undertaken. Blood work was normal (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and ferritin). Genetic testing was unremarkable (normal karyotype, negative for fragile X) and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in search of a demyelinating attack of the white matter, electroencephalography (EEG), optometry assessment were also normal. At the conclusion of this composite assessment, the boy was given a primary diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. A plan was instituted including speech-language therapy, intensive individualized educational programming, and contact was encouraged with the Autism Society. For that purpose, the parents moved to morocco to be surrounded by family without any huge improvement. Upon direct questioning at initial presentation, the 3-year-old child was reported by the parents to have unexplained fatigue, Gastrointestinal symptoms included bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Psychiatric symptoms included a frequently depressed mood, disproportionate anger, and emotional lability. On exploring his history, the child was born from yemenite father and Moroccan mother in Germany at-term weighing 3500 g with an Apgar score of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. No concerns were present in the neonatal period. Development in the first 24 months of life appeared fine according to the parents-his motor skills seemed to progress normally and he achieved expected milestones. After 2 years of age, however, his language skills slowly began to regress. He also demonstrated a change in temperament as he started to whine repeatedly and to scream without provocation. Physical examination revealed a height and weight normal for age. He was uncommunicative, restless, and somewhat agitated. General examination was unremarkable other than dark rings around the eyes. There were no dysmorphic features evident. He had difficulty maintaining eye contact, and he appeared disinterested in what was taking place. No abnormality was found on abdominal assessment. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were 76 U (normal < 10). The patient underwent upper endoscopy as duodenal biopsy to confirm a celiac disease diagnosis. It shows a total villous atrophy corresponding to a stage 4 of Marsh classification. Given the positive screen for celiac disease (positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and results of duodenal biopsy), dietary intervention was immediately commenced. All gluten was eliminated from the boy's diet. Within 1 month, the boy's gastrointestinal symptoms were relieved and his behavior had changed. The mother reported that her boy became progressively more communicative. The child has continued on the gluten-free diet and has progressed well and remained healthy over the following 6 months.

He has no family history of illness or autistic spectrum disorder. The history revealed that at 2 years of age. The child was diagnosed with a ‘‘severe communication disorder,'' with social interaction difficulties and sensory processing delay. A composite follow-up of all previous assessments and investigations was undertaken. Blood work was normal (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and ferritin). Genetic testing was unremarkable (normal karyotype, negative for fragile X) and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in search of a demyelinating attack of the white matter, electroencephalography (EEG), optometry assessment were also normal. At the conclusion of this composite assessment, the boy was given a primary diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. A plan was instituted including speech-language therapy, intensive individualized educational programming, and contact was encouraged with the Autism Society. For that purpose, the parents moved to morocco to be surrounded by family without any huge improvement. Upon direct questioning at initial presentation, the 3-year-old child was reported by the parents to have unexplained fatigue, Gastrointestinal symptoms included bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Psychiatric symptoms included a frequently depressed mood, disproportionate anger, and emotional lability. On exploring his history, the child was born from yemenite father and Moroccan mother in Germany at-term weighing 3500 g with an Apgar score of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. No concerns were present in the neonatal period. Development in the first 24 months of life appeared fine according to the parents-his motor skills seemed to progress normally and he achieved expected milestones. After 2 years of age, however, his language skills slowly began to regress. He also demonstrated a change in temperament as he started to whine repeatedly and to scream without provocation. Physical examination revealed a height and weight normal for age. He was uncommunicative, restless, and somewhat agitated. General examination was unremarkable other than dark rings around the eyes. There were no dysmorphic features evident. He had difficulty maintaining eye contact, and he appeared disinterested in what was taking place. No abnormality was found on abdominal assessment. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were 76 U (normal < 10). The patient underwent upper endoscopy as duodenal biopsy to confirm a celiac disease diagnosis. It shows a total villous atrophy corresponding to a stage 4 of Marsh classification.

She was appointed to hospital by a private outpatient surgical center where she had undergone perineal abscess drainage a week before. Recent medical history included also endometrial curettage for ERPC a month before and conservative therapy for hemorrhoids 15 days after. Past medical history included Henoch-Schönlein purpura during childhood. Social history included smoking (11 pack-years), family history was non-contributory. She had no known drug allergies. Complete blood count revealed marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (WBC 23.400 /lt). A CT scan revealed small bilateral pleural effusions, small hepatic enlargement, Gerota's fascia thickening, perineal soft tissue stranding with fascial thickening and small bubbles of air. Fournier's gangrene was set as working diagnosis (calculated FGSI 8, UFGSI 10 and LRINEC 7) and the patient was transported to operation room for immediate radical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. Blood and surgical material was taken for microbiologic analysis. Due to the extent of the surgical debridement, the patient was admitted postoperatively to the ICU (SOFA score 6, APACHE II score 12); where sedation (midazolam 30 mcg/kg/hr c.iv), analgesia (fentanyl 3 mcg/kg/min c.iv), triple antibiotic regimen with meropenem 2gr q8h i.v., clindamycin 600mg q 6h i.v. and daptomycin 500mg q.d. i.v., gastroprotective and antithrombotic prophylaxis were initiated. During the next 3 days a second CT and an obstetrical consultation were conducted with no significant findings. Human immunodeficiency virus and diabetic screen were also negative. Yet, the patient remained febrile. Microbiology cultures from material taken from the surgical trauma area revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumonia ; hence antibiotic regimen was modified and antimycotic treatment (caspofungin 100mg q.d. i.v.) was initiated too. Debridements were repeated every 24 hours but due to the extent of the lesions, on the 10 th day, the patient was transported to operation room for temporary ileostomy till the end of the therapy. Percutaneous tracheotomy was also performed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not available at the setting. One day after the second surgery, patient's condition complicated with MRSA ventilation associated pneumonia. Along with that, a localized oedema appeared in her left upper limb. A palpable mass along the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was also noticed. Vascular ultrasound examination revealed occlusion of left internal jugular vein. Transcranial Doppler examination was normal. Dental consultation and examination of soft palate and peritonsilar tissues showed no abnormalities. Linezolide 600 mg q12h i.v. was added to antibiotic regimen. Since debridements were going on, simultaneous anticoagulation therapy was started with only bemiparine 2500 b.i.d. s.c. Gradually, the patient became afebrile and her clinical condition improved. She was discharged from ICU 13 days later. A follow-up CTA confirmed the disappearance of the left jugular vein thrombosis. About a month after her ICU discharge, an operation was performed for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of the right gluteal region. On a follow-up examination 6 months later, the young woman had returned to her normal everyday life.

She was appointed to hospital by a private outpatient surgical center where she had undergone perineal abscess drainage a week before. Recent medical history included also endometrial curettage for ERPC a month before and conservative therapy for hemorrhoids 15 days after. Past medical history included Henoch-Schönlein purpura during childhood. Social history included smoking (11 pack-years), family history was non-contributory. She had no known drug allergies. Complete blood count revealed marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (WBC 23.400 /lt). A CT scan revealed small bilateral pleural effusions, small hepatic enlargement, Gerota's fascia thickening, perineal soft tissue stranding with fascial thickening and small bubbles of air. Fournier's gangrene was set as working diagnosis (calculated FGSI 8, UFGSI 10 and LRINEC 7) and the patient was transported to operation room for immediate radical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. Blood and surgical material was taken for microbiologic analysis. Due to the extent of the surgical debridement, the patient was admitted postoperatively to the ICU (SOFA score 6, APACHE II score 12); where sedation (midazolam 30 mcg/kg/hr c.iv), analgesia (fentanyl 3 mcg/kg/min c.iv), triple antibiotic regimen with meropenem 2gr q8h i.v., clindamycin 600mg q 6h i.v. and daptomycin 500mg q.d. i.v., gastroprotective and antithrombotic prophylaxis were initiated. During the next 3 days a second CT and an obstetrical consultation were conducted with no significant findings. Human immunodeficiency virus and diabetic screen were also negative. Yet, the patient remained febrile. Microbiology cultures from material taken from the surgical trauma area revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumonia ; hence antibiotic regimen was modified and antimycotic treatment (caspofungin 100mg q.d. i.v.) was initiated too. Debridements were repeated every 24 hours but due to the extent of the lesions, on the 10 th day, the patient was transported to operation room for temporary ileostomy till the end of the therapy. Percutaneous tracheotomy was also performed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not available at the setting. One day after the second surgery, patient's condition complicated with MRSA ventilation associated pneumonia. Along with that, a localized oedema appeared in her left upper limb. A palpable mass along the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was also noticed. Vascular ultrasound examination revealed occlusion of left internal jugular vein. Transcranial Doppler examination was normal. Dental consultation and examination of soft palate and peritonsilar tissues showed no abnormalities. Linezolide 600 mg q12h i.v. was added to antibiotic regimen. Since debridements were going on, simultaneous anticoagulation therapy was started with only bemiparine 2500 b.i.d. s.c. Gradually, the patient became afebrile and her clinical condition improved. She was discharged from ICU 13 days later. A follow-up CTA confirmed the disappearance of the left jugular vein thrombosis. About a month after her ICU discharge, an operation was performed for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of the right gluteal region. On a follow-up examination 6 months later, the young woman had returned to her normal everyday life.

Due to the extent of the surgical debridement, the patient was admitted postoperatively to the ICU (SOFA score 6, APACHE II score 12); where sedation (midazolam 30 mcg/kg/hr c.iv), analgesia (fentanyl 3 mcg/kg/min c.iv), triple antibiotic regimen with meropenem 2gr q8h i.v., clindamycin 600mg q 6h i.v. and daptomycin 500mg q.d. i.v., gastroprotective and antithrombotic prophylaxis were initiated. During the next 3 days a second CT and an obstetrical consultation were conducted with no significant findings. Human immunodeficiency virus and diabetic screen were also negative. Yet, the patient remained febrile. Microbiology cultures from material taken from the surgical trauma area revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumonia ; hence antibiotic regimen was modified and antimycotic treatment (caspofungin 100mg q.d. i.v.) was initiated too. Debridements were repeated every 24 hours but due to the extent of the lesions, on the 10 th day, the patient was transported to operation room for temporary ileostomy till the end of the therapy. Percutaneous tracheotomy was also performed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not available at the setting. One day after the second surgery, patient's condition complicated with MRSA ventilation associated pneumonia. Along with that, a localized oedema appeared in her left upper limb. A palpable mass along the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was also noticed. Vascular ultrasound examination revealed occlusion of left internal jugular vein. Transcranial Doppler examination was normal. Dental consultation and examination of soft palate and peritonsilar tissues showed no abnormalities. Linezolide 600 mg q12h i.v. was added to antibiotic regimen. Since debridements were going on, simultaneous anticoagulation therapy was started with only bemiparine 2500 b.i.d. s.c. Gradually, the patient became afebrile and her clinical condition improved. She was discharged from ICU 13 days later. A follow-up CTA confirmed the disappearance of the left jugular vein thrombosis. About a month after her ICU discharge, an operation was performed for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of the right gluteal region. On a follow-up examination 6 months later, the young woman had returned to her normal everyday life.

A palpable mass along the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was also noticed. Vascular ultrasound examination revealed occlusion of left internal jugular vein. Transcranial Doppler examination was normal. Dental consultation and examination of soft palate and peritonsilar tissues showed no abnormalities. Linezolide 600 mg q12h i.v. was added to antibiotic regimen. Since debridements were going on, simultaneous anticoagulation therapy was started with only bemiparine 2500 b.i.d. s.c. Gradually, the patient became afebrile and her clinical condition improved. She was discharged from ICU 13 days later. A follow-up CTA confirmed the disappearance of the left jugular vein thrombosis. About a month after her ICU discharge, an operation was performed for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of the right gluteal region. On a follow-up examination 6 months later, the young woman had returned to her normal everyday life.

She was appointed to hospital by a private outpatient surgical center where she had undergone perineal abscess drainage a week before. Recent medical history included also endometrial curettage for ERPC a month before and conservative therapy for hemorrhoids 15 days after. Past medical history included Henoch-Schönlein purpura during childhood. Social history included smoking (11 pack-years), family history was non-contributory. She had no known drug allergies. Complete blood count revealed marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (WBC 23.400 /lt). A CT scan revealed small bilateral pleural effusions, small hepatic enlargement, Gerota's fascia thickening, perineal soft tissue stranding with fascial thickening and small bubbles of air. Fournier's gangrene was set as working diagnosis (calculated FGSI 8, UFGSI 10 and LRINEC 7) and the patient was transported to operation room for immediate radical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. Blood and surgical material was taken for microbiologic analysis. Due to the extent of the surgical debridement, the patient was admitted postoperatively to the ICU (SOFA score 6, APACHE II score 12); where sedation (midazolam 30 mcg/kg/hr c.iv), analgesia (fentanyl 3 mcg/kg/min c.iv), triple antibiotic regimen with meropenem 2gr q8h i.v., clindamycin 600mg q 6h i.v. and daptomycin 500mg q.d. i.v., gastroprotective and antithrombotic prophylaxis were initiated. During the next 3 days a second CT and an obstetrical consultation were conducted with no significant findings. Human immunodeficiency virus and diabetic screen were also negative. Yet, the patient remained febrile. Microbiology cultures from material taken from the surgical trauma area revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumonia ; hence antibiotic regimen was modified and antimycotic treatment (caspofungin 100mg q.d. i.v.) was initiated too. Debridements were repeated every 24 hours but due to the extent of the lesions, on the 10 th day, the patient was transported to operation room for temporary ileostomy till the end of the therapy. Percutaneous tracheotomy was also performed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not available at the setting. One day after the second surgery, patient's condition complicated with MRSA ventilation associated pneumonia. Along with that, a localized oedema appeared in her left upper limb.
